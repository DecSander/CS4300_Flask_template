The popularity grew over time but this breed was mainly seen in wealthy families and among royalty. The Afghan Hound was brought to America in the 1920s and was accepted by the American Kennel Society (AKC) in 1926. The breed became popular in the show ring for a while but lost its popularity since then. The Border Collie is thought to have been seen in wood carvings done by Thomas Beckwick from the History of the Quadrupeds sometime before the 1800s. During the late 1800s, the first sheepdog trial was held and won by a Border Collie named Hemp. The story states that Hemp was able to herd these sheep by just looking at them rather than barking and nipping at their heels. It is thought that Queen Victoria became fond of these dogs when she saw one in Balmoral. The standard of the Border Collie was established in 1906 with a heavy emphasis on their working ability and not their physical attributes. In fact, the breed was known as a sheepdog until 1915 when they were named Border Collies.

Because they are naturally excellent hunters, they were used thousands of years ago by the nomads in India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to hunt large game. According to the AKC, the Afghan Hound was able to take down both small and large animals such as antelopes and leopards by grabbing them by the neck. It is said that this breed was commonly owned by leaders of war such as Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan. Interestingly, Zeppo Marx of the Marx Brothers was one of the first owners of Afghan Hounds in the United States. Another interesting fact is that the Afghan Hound became extremely popular in 1981 after Mattel introduced Barbie\u2019s pet Afghan Hound named Beauty. In addition, the first dog to be cloned was an Afghan Hound named Snuppy. This was done in 2005 in South Korea by using skin cells of a three-year-old Afghan Hound and 123 surrogate mothers.

In regards to the German Shepherd, the roots of the breed can be traced back to 7th century A.D. With the help of the German army, the breed was modified into a military dog around 1880; between the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s, the breed was developed into an all-purpose working dog.\u00a0"}, {"name": "airedale-terrier", "activity": "The Airedale likes to be top dog and because of this, socialization at the dog park or in obedience classes should be part and parcel of this pup's upbringing.

Airedale Terriers are energetic and need lots of attention from their humans so be prepared to spend at least one or two hours per day with your dog. They are not great in apartments but if living in that environment would rather have a large area with a big yard to play in. However, if left alone in the yard too long with nothing to do, you may find holes all over the place so be sure to provide your Airedale with plenty of activities and toys outside.

They were originally used by the Yorkshiremen to hunt large rats on the Aire River. They even had rat hunting competitions. The Airedale Terrier was first named the Waterside or Bingley Terrier but was then named Airedale in 1878 for the area where it originated. The Airedale Terrier became a dog show favorite and as breeders became more interested in its appearance, they started breeding it with Bull and Irish Terriers. One famous Airedale Terrier whose name was Master Briar became a star in 1900 after he won many show championships. Other famous dogs include Little Duke, who was owned by the late actor, John (Duke) Wayne; President Woodrow Wilson had an Airedale named Davie; Calvin Coolidge owned Laddie Buck (also called Paul Pry); and Warren Harding owned one named Laddie Boy. This breed was also known for serving with the troops in World War I as a hunter, messenger, and guard. They are also still used in law enforcement sometimes.

There is a debate about the name between the United States, Canada, and the rest of the country. According to the US and Canada, there is only one breed of Akita and there are two types, the American Akita and Japanese Akita. However, the rest of the world considers these two as separate breeds.\u00a0The Akita Inu Hozonkai Society of Japan was founded in the late 1920s and the breed was designated as a national treasure to Japan in 1937. The reason for this decision was the loyalty of the Akita, Haichiko, who met his owner at the train station every day at a certain time. Haichiko continued to go to the train station every day to wait for him for almost a decade after his owner died. The first Akita in the United States was given as a gift to Helen Keller from the Japanese government while she was there visiting. Her name was Kamikaze-Go. However, the American Kennel Club did not officially recognize the breed until 1972, almost 40 years later.\u00a0The Akita comes from the Northern Spitz breed. The original purpose of the breed was to hunt large animals such as elk, bear, deer, and wild boar. The hunters had the Akita flush out and corner the game until they were able to come and shoot it. Some also trained their Akita for fighting by mixing them with a fighting dog breed, called the Tosa. After a fatal outbreak of rabies in the early 1900s where over 3,000 Akitas died, that tradition was stopped.

In 1927, the Akita Inu Hozonkai Society of Japan was formed with a goal of preserving the original Akita and in 1931 the breed was given the designation of a national treasure of Japan. The breed became more common in the United States after WW II when soldiers returned from serving in Japan with the dogs in tow. Dogs of the breed often work as guard dogs or as a part of law enforcement. As for the Pit Bull, the original \u201cbulldog\u201d that was used for boar hunting and as a guard, is seen in paintings that go as far back as the 1500\u2019s. These dogs look a lot like the Pit Bull we see today. They were called bull dogs as a result of being the dog best suited to the sport of bull baiting. In 1835 bull baiting was outlawed in England and its promoters sought a new way to profit, turning to ratting and dog fighting. It is thought that at this time, one or more types of Terriers were mixed with the dog so that it would have a higher drive to seek prey and be more aggressive as well as reduce its size and increase its agility. The American Pit Bull Terrier is the product of English and Irish stock that arrived in the US during the 19th century. These dogs did well as cattle dogs and dogs that could catch pigs. While some were still used in fights, the majority of them worked as hunters, herders, guardians and friends, even earning the nickname of nanny dog.\u00a0"}, {"name": "akita-shepherd", "activity": "Herding and Spitz breeds are known for their fortitude and work\nethic; the Akita Shepherd is no exception.

During the 20th century, German Shepherds grew in popularity\nnot only in their native country, but also in North America as a working and\nguard dog, as well as loyal pet. The American Kennel Club recognized the German Shepherd in 1908\nand it remains a popular dog in the United States and Europe \u2013 especially\nGermany \u2013 to this day. The other parent,\nthe Akita Inu, is an ancient breed from the Odate region of Japan. In the mid-1900s,\nAkitas Inus were declared a national treasure of Japan. Even today, Akitas Inus\nare considered spiritual symbols of protection, health, happiness, and\nlongevity in the country. Akita Inus were first bred to hunt animals large and\nmedium sized game, such as elk, boars, and small bears. The American historical\nfigure, Helen Keller, became enamored with the breed in the mid-20th\ncentury and brought the first Akita to North America. Afterwards, the Akita population\ngrew steadily in the United States and it was recognized by the AKC in 1972. The\ncombination of these two parent breeds has resulted in the stoic and devoted Akita\nShepherd breed.

Dogs\nclosely resembling the Alano Espanol were found in several different places\nthroughout Europe that were invaded by the Alans.

The Alano Espanol was used for centuries to\nherd cattle that ran wild throughout many regions of Spain.\nThis breed had five main purposes. Aside from herding wild cattle they were\nused in bullfights and dog fights, as big game hunters and guard dogs, and were even\nused in times of war. Because the Alano Espanol was used for hunting wild boar,\ndog fighters saw their potential to be successful in the fighting pits. They\nwere also used extensively in bullfights until bullfighting was banned in 1883.\u00a0Carlos Contera, along with several of his colleagues, searched\nthroughout Spain\nfor any remaining Alano Espanol purebreds, fearing they were extinct. Contera\nwas able to locate a handful in southwest Spain\nin an area called Extremadura and in the central plateau of Castille. The team\nalso found a rather large number of Alano Espanol in northern Spain\nin the Encartaciones Valley.\nThe DNA of these dogs was sent to the University\n of Cordoba\u2019s School\n of Veterinary Medicine to verify\nthe authenticity of the breed. In the early 1980s a group of researchers began\ntracing the demographic layout of the Alano Espanol. Today, the Alano Espanol\nis still used as a guard dog and on occasion works cattle.

At the time, the Mahlemuts used the Alaskan Malamutes as hunting dogs to help them hunt polar bears and seals and were used as sled dogs as well. Sometime during the 1700s, explorers were impressed by the Alaskan Malamutes for their strength and affection and this increased the breed\u2019s popularity a great deal. During the gold rush of 1896, the miners started using the dogs in weight-pulling competitions for entertainment. At that time, Alaskan Malamutes were bred with other breeds to make them faster and to increase the number of dogs to race. This caused the breed to be diminished and it took until the 1920s for breeders to start trying to purify the breed again, the Alaskan Malamute as it is today being the result. In 1933, several Alaskan Malamutes were used to help Richard Byrd in his Antarctic expedition. During World War II, these dogs were used as working dogs alongside the soldiers in battle. The Alaskan Malamute is the 59th most popular breed in the United States and was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1935. The breed was featured on a stamp issued by the United States postal service in 1984 and in several other countries.

They are brave and strong-willing dogs that are generally non-hostile by nature, but a good owner will ensure proper socialization and training to make sure their behavior is as close as possible to ideal. Because of their emotional nature, they generally react much better to positive reinforcement and are known to sulk and pout if scolded too harshly, so patience with them is a virtue. With the right amount of attention, they are largely well-behaved dogs but without frequent exercise, playtime, and mental stimulation, can become destructive and develop troublesome behavior. They are generally better suited for homes with larger yards or space to run, as their activity requirements are quite high, but they are adaptable to smaller spaces if they end up with an active owner who gives them considerable exercise daily.

They are largely believed to be the descendants of the Old English Bulldog and came to the American South with working class immigrant settlers from West Midlands in England before the Industrial Revolution. Farmers and ranchers prized the dogs for their ability to hunt feral pigs, which were a nearly predator-less nuisance at the time, \"catch\" or help control their cattle, and provide overall protection for their property and family. Prior to 1835, when blood sports were outlawed in England and eventually the US, they were also used in the brutal sports of bull and bear baiting, where the animals were pitted against each other. Since the breed was used purely as a utility dog, there was no attempt to control bloodlines or document ancestry, and those who owned and bred them did so based upon the best working characteristics they could find. By the end of World War II, the American Bulldog, simply called \"bulldogs\" at the time after their primary work purpose, was nearly extinct until a war veteran named John D. Johnson returned home and attempted to revitalize the breed. After combing the rural farms and back roads of the South in search of the best candidates, he caught the attention of a young man named Alan Scott, who took interest in the dogs and began breeding his own catch-dog finds with Johnson's line, eventually developing what is known as the Standard American Bulldog. Johnson himself eventually interbred his line with the English Bulldog, creating the Classic or Bully type. Today, many American Bulldogs are a cross between the two and are still used as\u00a0utility dogs for hunting and \"catching\" as well as sport and protection.

The Rottweiler originates back to the Roman Empire era but did not gain much popularity until the early 20th century. The Rottweiler was originally used as a guard dog and as a policing dog to protect. Today, the Rottweiler is known as an intelligent breed with a confident stance when out in public.

They are about 15 inches tall and weigh between 20 and 30 pounds. Their body is sturdy and compact, with a chiselled head that is perfectly balanced. The skull should be round with no flatness at all and clearly defined eyebrows. The long, lobular ears are floppy and feathered. Their slightly almond shaped dark brown eyes are large and round but they should not be bulging. The American Cocker Spaniel has a soft but alert and intelligent looking expression that their owners find especially appealing. The muzzle is square, deep, and broad with a black or brown nose and the upper lips should be full with enough depth to cover the jaw. Their teeth are strong and have a scissors bite. The American Cocker Spaniel has a long, muscular neck with a deep chest and strong sloping back. The docked tail should be in line with the back or a little higher but not straight up like some Terriers. Overall, they have an elegant and friendly look perfect for a house pet or hunting dog.", "maintenance": "The American Cocker Spaniel has a lot of hair that you will see all over the house even with extensive grooming. With their long, silky hair, they require a thorough brushing about three or four times a week to prevent matting. Using a metal comb and slicker brush is recommended, working from front to back from the floor up. With such long ears, they tend to collect dirt and wax, so they need to be cleaned at least once per week. Without proper cleaning, they can be susceptible to ear infections such as otitis media. Their eyes should be checked at this time too because they are so large and unprotected. You will need to trim their nails regularly as well and have them professionally groomed every few months. Baths should be given once a month with a mild shampoo recommended by a veterinary care provider. They are a medium sized breed so they will be happy living in an apartment or house with a big yard. They do need daily exercise though and appreciate a walk or a trip to the dog park. This breed, like others, should be fed a high quality dog food appropriate for its age and weight.", "temperament": "The American Cocker Spaniel is a good natured and friendly dog with a happy personality. They are also intelligent and easy to train and will be extremely obedient when trained properly. This breed needs a lot of attention and play and does not like to be left alone for long periods of time. Loud noises and rowdiness can stress out your American Cocker Spaniel so they are not great in a home with small children. Also, they were bred to be hunters so they should not be trusted around birds such as chickens and ducks or even with pets like hamsters, mice, or guinea pigs. They do like to bark often and may annoy your neighbors if not trained properly. They are somewhat laid back and will be just as happy to lay on the couch watching television with you instead of running around in the yard. However, they do need plenty of exercise to prevent obesity, which can cause many health problems.", "size": "Weight: 25-30 lbs", "history": "According to the AKC, the Spaniel family has been around since the 14th century. It is said that the first Spaniels came to the United States on the Mayflower in 1620 but were not registered until 1878. In 1946, the AKC registered the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed, leaving the American Cocker Spaniel listed separately. The breeds were divided between land and water spaniels. The land spaniels are also divided by size. They were all bred to hunt, either on land or water, and the American Cocker Spaniel is the smallest of the breed. The American Cocker Spaniel was bred to flush out and retrieve game birds such as woodcocks, which is where they got their name. The English Cocker Spaniels were brought to the United States in the 1800s by hunting enthusiasts who appreciated their skillful way of hunting birds. However, some American breeders decided to breed them for shows and wanted them to be smaller in stature. This also made them popular as companion pets and soon they were one of the most popular purebred dogs in the United States. Because of their great popularity, commercial puppy mills and breeders popped up all over the United States, ignoring the health conditions and temperament of the dogs and producing a generally unhealthy group of Spaniels. Luckily, with strict breeding laws and the closure of puppy mills, the American Cocker Spaniel breed was able to recover. Although this breed is still widely used as a hunting dog, they are also found as companion pets just as often."}]
