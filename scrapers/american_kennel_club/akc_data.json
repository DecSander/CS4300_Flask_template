        "General_apperance": "The Affenpinscher is a balanced, wiry-haired terrier-like toy dog whose intelligence and demeanor make him a good house pet. Originating in Germany, the name Affenpinscher means \u201cmonkey-like terrier.\u201d The breed was developed to rid the kitchens, granaries, and stables of rodents. In France the breed is described as the \u201cDiablotin Moustachu,\u201d or moustached little devil, reflecting both the appearance and attitude of this delightful breed.

Some dogs are prone to getting\u00a0overweight, so watch your dog\u2019s calorie consumption and weight level.\u00a0Treats\u00a0can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity.

        "grooming": "The Affenpinscher\u2019s medium-length, wiry coat should be groomed twice a week, first with a brush and then with a metal comb. Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen\u2019s coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice. The breed\u2019s national parent club, the Affenpinscher Club of America, provides a detailed\u00a0grooming guide. Affens should also have their\u00a0nails trimmed\u00a0and their\u00a0teeth brushed\u00a0regularly.",
        "exercise": "One of the attractions of the toy breeds is that their\u00a0small size\u00a0makes them ideal apartment dogs. While Affenpinschers can be perfectly happy living in close quarters, the breed is classified as \u201cmoderately active,\u201d and as such, they do need\u00a0exercise. Indoor play, both with his owner and just between himself and a toy, can be enough to make up a large chunk of an Affen\u2019s exercise regimen. Even so, a\u00a0brisk walk\u00a0once or twice a day is required. In addition to providing exercise, these walks give the Affen a chance to socialize both with people and other dogs.",

The breed has an undeserved reputation as being difficult to train becauseAffenpinschers are independent minded and can be stubborn. The key is that they are very intelligent and generally eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Keep in mind that they are easily bored and tend to lose interest during long training sessions. Shorter, more frequent sessions with a trainer who has experience working with\u00a0toy breeds\u00a0are usually quite successful.",

        "General_apperance": "The Afghan Hound is an aristocrat, his whole appearance one of dignity and aloofness with no trace of plainness or coarseness.

The striking characteristics of the breed-exotic, or \u201cEastern,\u201d expression, long silky topknot, peculiar coat pattern, very prominent hipbones, large feet, and the impression of a somewhat exaggerated bend in the stifle due to profuse trouserings-stand out clearly, giving the Afghan Hound the appearance of what he is, a king of dogs, that has held true to tradition throughout the ages.\n",

As sight hounds, Afghan Hounds have naturally svelte physiques, and their protruding hipbones are a unique breed characteristic, not a sign of being underweight. That said, Afghan Hounds are athletic, active dogs, so be mindful that your dog is getting enough good nutrition to meet his needs.\u00a0Learn about which\u00a0human foods\u00a0are safe for dogs, and which are not.

        "grooming": "Afghan puppies have short, fuzzy coats (including adorable facial hair called \u201cmonkey whiskers\u201d) that require little maintenance. They don\u2019t stay that way for long, however. As is to be expected, the long, silky coat of an adolescent or adult Afghan requires regular\u00a0grooming. Several hours per week of brushing are needed to keep the hair free of tangles and mats, as well as to remove any debris. Keeping the hair clean and mat-free is the key to keeping the Afghan\u2019s glorious coat looking its best.\u00a0Regular bathing, with shampoo and conditioner, is also required. Like all breeds, Afghans should have their\u00a0nails trimmed\u00a0and their\u00a0teeth brushed\u00a0regularly.",
        "exercise": "Because Afghans are sighthounds, bred to hunt and chase prey by sight, they will have a strong instinct to run off in pursuit of perceived prey; walking off leash is not advisable. Short walks do not provide enough exercise for this athletic breed, and some owners take their leashed Afghans on long runs once they reach maturity. Ideally, an Afghan should have the opportunity to run full out several times a week in a large, enclosed area. Afghans are tall, lean, and strong, which makes them excellent jumpers, so their exercise area must have a high, secure fence.",
        "training": "Afghans are independent, dignified, and aloof in general, but they are affectionate and extremely loyal to humans they have bonded with. This loyalty can make it difficult for an adult Afghan to adjust to a new home. On the other hand, it can make them fairly easy to housetrain, because they want to please their owners. Unless\u00a0obedience\u00a0or\u00a0agility\u00a0competition is a goal, teaching\u00a0basic commands\u00a0such as come, sit, and stay is generally sufficient. Afghan Hound owners are often quick to point out that no amount of training will overcome the breed\u2019s hunting instinct to break off on a high-speed chase.",
        "health": "Sighthounds such as Afghans have naturally low stores of body fat, so they tend to be sensitive to anesthesia; breed experts recommend seeking out a sighthound-savvy veterinarian for surgical procedures. Like other deep-chested types of dogs, Afghan Hounds can experience\u00a0bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.",

Weekly brushing keeps the coat looking good and has the additional advantage of removing dead hair that would otherwise be shed around the house. (Some people with dog allergies have found that they can share a living space with a well-brushed Airedale without suffering any symptoms.) If the weekly session turns up any mats, they should be broken up with the fingers and then teased apart with a comb. Full grooming \u2014 where the dog is bathed, brushed, and stripped or clipped \u2014 should be done three or four times a year, either by the owner or a professional groomer.",
        "exercise": "Terriers are generally known for their high energy levels. Given that the Airedale is the largest of all terriers, that energy must be channeled into safe outlets. Fortunately, Airedales love to play with other family members. A daily play session of moderate length, in addition to walks (or backyard time) several times a day, should be enough to satisfy the Airedale\u2019s exercise requirements. Airedales play well with children, but interactions with toddlers and smaller children should be closely supervised. Airedales are rangy but strong; that strength, combined with a boisterous personality, can lead to mishaps.",
        "training": "Because of the Airedale\u2019s size (he is a medium-sized dog, but the largest of the terrier breeds), strength, and rambunctiousness,\u00a0obedience training is highly recommended. At a minimum, an Airedale should learn basic obedience commands such as come, sit, and stay. The breed\u2019s intelligence and the fact that they bond closely with family members can make training easy. Owners and trainers should keep in mind that an\u00a0intelligent dog is an easily bored dog, so varied training sessions will be more successful than repetitive ones.

As large and very powerful dogs, it is vital that they are trained consistently,\u00a0\u00a0beginning in puppyhood. They are instinctive guardians, so it\u2019s especially important that Akitas have early and extensive socialization when young. They must learn to accept a wide variety of strangers and not perceive them as a threat. Because of their independence and strong prey drive, they should never be off lead in an unsecured area.

        "General_apperance": "The Alaskan Malamute, one of the oldest Arctic sled dogs, is a powerful and substantially built dog with a deep chest and strong, well-muscled body. The Malamute stands well over the pads, and this stance gives the appearance of much activity and a proud carriage, with head erect and eyes alert showing interest and curiosity. The head is broad. Ears are triangular and erect when alerted. The muzzle is bulky, only slight diminishing in width from root to nose. The muzzle is not pointed or long, yet not stubby. The coat is thick with a coarse guard coat of sufficient length to protect a woolly undercoat. Malamutes are of various colors. Face markings are a distinguishing feature. These consist of a cap over the head, the face either all white or marked with a bar and/or mask. The tail is well furred, carried over the back, and has the appearance of a waving plume.\n",

        "grooming": "The thick, waterproof double coat of the Alaskan Malamute is beautifully adapted to harsh Arctic life, but it requires constant upkeep. A Malamute should be brushed every day with a pin brush and metal comb, all the while checking for mats, which can harbor fungus, and hot spots, which can become infected. Twice a year, during shedding season, an undercoat rake should be added to the regimen. Show Malamutes are often bathed weekly, but a pet Malamute can go six to eight weeks between baths.  Conditioner can be used, in moderation, if the coat feels dry. As with all breeds, the Malamute\u2019s nails should be trimmed regularly.",
        "exercise": "While the Malamute was not bred for racing, he was bred to work. A strong, athletic dog with tremendous endurance, designed to carry heavy loads, a Mal requires daily exercise. Romping in a well-fenced yard or other enclosed space will suffice, but Malamutes also enjoy hiking, running, and swimming with their owners. And should the owner have sufficient time and interest, Malamutes often take part in agility and obedience trials, weight-pulling competitions, backpacking (yes, you can buy a backpack for your dog), recreational or competitive sledding, and skijoring (pulling a person who is on skis).",
        "training": "Socialization and\u00a0obedience training are necessary in order to prevent a Malamute from becoming pushy with children and other pets, or dominant over adults he or she doesn\u2019t respect. Malamutes are highly intelligent but also independent and willful, often to the point of stubbornness. While fairness and patience can yield a devoted, trustworthy companion, there are certain behaviors that may be impossible to train out of a Mal, such as\u00a0digging, so any yard fencing must continue into the ground.

Skin problems are quite rare in the breed.

A trim with clippers every few months can be done by a groomer, but many owners learn how to do it themselves. As with all breeds, the BRT\u2019s nails should be trimmed regularly.",

In the backyard, he and his owner can play with a ball or a flying disc. A BRT who doesn\u2019t get enough exercise will become unhappy and destructive, and one who doesn\u2019t spend enough time with his human family can develop aggressive tendencies. Many BRTs excel at canine sports such as obedience, agility, rally, and Schutzhund (protection) competitions.",

Socialization needs to start in puppyhood and continue throughout the dog\u2019s lifetime in order to prevent aggressive behavior.  Obedience training also needs to start as early as possible and should continue well into adulthood. BRTs are dominating and will become pushy with anyone they can intimidate. Training must be firm and consistent, but always reward based, never punishment based. The BRT is intelligent and learns quickly, but only if he is treated with kindness and respect.",

Coat colors can be black and tan, liver and tan, or red. Powerful legs allow Bloodhounds to scent over miles of punishing terrain.\nAs pack dogs, Bloodhounds enjoy company, including other dogs and kids. They are easygoing, but their nose can sometimes lead them into trouble. A strong leash and long walks in places where they can enjoy sniffing around are recommended. Bloodhounds are droolers, and obedience training these sensitive sleuths can be a challenge.\n",

Affectionate family dogs, Borzoi are nonetheless a bit too dignified to wholeheartedly enjoy a lot of roughhousing.

To accomplish this purpose, the Borzoi needed particular structural qualities to chase, catch and hold his quarry. Special emphasis is placed on sound running gear, strong neck and jaws, courage and agility, combined with proper condition. The Borzoi should always possess unmistakable elegance, with flowing lines, graceful in motion or repose. Males, masculine without coarseness; bitches, feminine and refined.\n",

Borzoi enjoy doing activities with their owners and excel in canine sports such as agility and lure coursing.",

Exposing the puppy to positive experiences with a wide variety of people, places, and situations will help him develop into a well-adjusted adult. Borzoi are intelligent and very affectionate with their owners, but are also independent and sometimes stubborn, so training may be a challenge. Patience and consistency are key.

Their muscles ripple beneath a short, tight-fitting coat. The dark brown eyes and wrinkled forehead give the face an alert, curious look. The coat can be fawn or brindle, with white markings. Boxers move like the athletes they are named for: smooth and graceful, with a powerful forward thrust.\nBoxers are upbeat and playful. Their patience and protective nature have earned them a reputation as a great dog with children. They take the jobs of watchdog and family guardian seriously and will meet threats fearlessly. Boxers do best when exposed to a lot of people and other animals in early puppyhood.\n",

His well-developed muscles are clean, hard, and appear smooth under taut skin. His movements denote energy. The gait is firm yet elastic, the stride free and ground-covering, the carriage proud. Developed to serve as guard, working, and companion dog, he combines strength and agility with elegance and style. His expression is alert and his temperament steadfast and tractable.\nThe chiseled head imparts to the Boxer a unique individual stamp. It must be in correct proportion to the body. The broad, blunt muzzle is the distinctive feature, and great value is placed upon its being of proper form and balance with the skull.\n",

A Briard should be brushed several times a week, completely to the skin, using a good-quality pin brush. Using an undercoat rake can help eliminate a lot of dead hair and lessen shedding. The number of baths a Briard will need depends entirely on his lifestyle and the jobs he is doing. Frequency may range from weekly to monthly, to even less.",

Their zest for life makes them great companions for hikers, bicyclers, and joggers. They need a large, securely fenced area where they can run free. Chasing a tennis ball thrown by his owner can help a Briard work off excess energy as well as giving him the human companionship he loves.",

Briards learn quickly and have an excellent memory. They excel at almost any canine role or sport, from catching discs to search-and-rescue, to obedience and agility. Socialization should begin early and continue throughout the Briard\u2019s life.",

His nickname was \u201cthe butcher\u2019s dog,\u201d as he was often seen lying at the doorsteps of butcher shops. He was a protector of the home and a herder and guard dog of cattle at the farm and in the city\u2019s markets. Today, his size is the only thing that keeps intruders at bay. The Broholmer has a heart of gold, loves to snuggle, and always wants to be near you, though his preference is to sit on you. He is an excellent dog with children and other dogs, though because he seems to underestimate his size, supervision is recommended. This breed is also remarkably agile for his size and can do agility, fetch balls, and jump and catch frisbees.

Coats come in fawn, red, or brindle.\nThese are biddable and reliable creatures, but as with any large guarding dog, owners must begin training and socialization early, while the puppy is still small enough to control.\n",

Several small meals are best for puppies, and two meals daily is a good routine for adults, so dogs don\u2019t have to digest too much food at each meal. Because of the risk of\u00a0bloat, exercise is discouraged immediately before and after eating. Bullmastiffs should be kept lean, especially as puppies, as they grow very rapidly, which can tax their systems.",
        "grooming": "Seasonal\u00a0shedding\u00a0is to be expected, though unusual hair loss should be noted as a possible problem. A balanced diet and a healthy environment are most important for coat health. Frequent\u00a0grooming\u00a0ensures that shedding can be managed, and dogs should be bathed as needed. The skin and coat should be monitored in order to ensure that dryness or oiliness are not issues. These can be related to diet, and sometimes to allergies.",

Some are more sedentary, while others are very active by nature, but moderate exercise should be encouraged.\u00a0Brisk walks\u00a0and outdoor play are favorites of the breed, although secure fencing is a must for outdoor areas. Fencing is critical to ensure that the dog is safely contained and so strangers and unfamiliar animals do not intrude on the Bullmastiff\u2019s territory. Puppies should not be overexercised, especially during periods of rapid growth. Bullmastiffs are not the ideal breed for people who want a canine running partner, but they are great walking companions.",
        "training": "Early training\u00a0and\u00a0socialization\u00a0are critical for Bullmastiff puppies. The breed can be quite strong willed, and dogs and owners will both benefit from training regimens instilled in puppyhood. Rules and routines should be put in place early and adhered to as dogs grow up. Many breeders will encourage new owners to enroll in local\u00a0puppy classes\u00a0in order to ensure that puppies are exposed to other dogs and that owners have access to training assistance and information. Bullmastiffs can excel in\u00a0agility,\u00a0obedience, rally, even scent work and\u00a0tracking, so training should begin immediately and be a part of the lifelong bond between dog and owner.",

In order to do the job of a guard dog, this\u00a0working breed\u00a0must be mentally and physically sound.

Like many dogs, both purebred and not, Bullmastiffs can develop cancer as well as bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen; owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.

The typical Carolina dog has pointed ears, a fox-like snout and a tail that curves like a fishhook when it is raised. They look similar to Australian Dingoes but, taxonomically, they fall under canis familiaris. Hesitant with strangers, they will sound the alarm when unaware of who\u2019s at the door, but once they see their people, they are ecstatic.

Chows can have rough or smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream.\nOwners say Chows are the cleanest of dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as cats. Well-socialized Chows are never fierce or intractable, but always refined and dignified. They are aloof with strangers and eternally loyal to loved ones. Serene and adaptable, with no special exercise needs, Chows happily take to city life.\n",

        "Blurb": "\n            The Chow Chow, an all-purpose dog of ancient China, presents the picture of a muscular, deep-chested aristocrat with an air of inscrutable timelessness. Dignified, serious-minded, and aloof, the Chow Chow is a breed of unique delights.\n        ",
        "General_apperance": "A powerful, sturdy, squarely built, upstanding dog of Arctic type, medium in size with strong muscular development and heavy bone. The body is compact, short coupled, broad and deep, the tail set high and carried closely to the back, the whole supported by four straight, strong, sound legs. Viewed from the side, the hind legs have little apparent angulation and the hock joint and metatarsals are directly beneath the hip joint. It is this structure which produces the characteristic shorter, stilted gait unique to the breed. The large head with broad, flat skull and short, broad and deep muzzle is proudly carried and accentuated by a ruff. Elegance and substance must be combined into a well balanced whole, never so massive as to outweigh his ability to be active, alert and agile. Clothed in a smooth or an offstanding rough double coat, the Chow is a masterpiece of beauty, dignity and naturalness. Essential to true Chow type are his unique blue-black tongue, scowling expression and stilted gait.\n",
        "nutrition": "There are many excellent-quality commercial dry and wet dog foods available. Many owners choose to feed a low-grain diet. Regularly check the Chow\u2019s skin for any irritation or other signs of allergy, even if you have not changed the commercial diet, as dog food companies frequently change the formulas. Be aware that dog treats can also create allergy and digestive issues. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet.",
        "grooming": "Both the rough- and smooth-coated Chows have a profuse double coat and require regular grooming. Thorough brushing at least twice per week and a monthly bath can keep the dog\u2019s skin and coat healthy. Be sure to immediately remedy any parasite issues, such as fleas or ticks. Include eye and ear care with each grooming, and trim nails regularly. Puppy coat and the coat around the head can become badly matted if not groomed regularly. Care must be taken to remove all mats and brush or comb through the undercoat. It is preferable to use a cool air dryer to thoroughly dry the Chow after a bath.",
        "exercise": "The Chow Chow is an active and alert dog with moderate exercise needs. The Chow requires daily walks and moderate play with toys, with minimal rough play or high-impact exercise. Avoid exercise during hot periods of the day, as the breed does not tolerate high heat or humidity well. A moderate-paced walk four or more times a day will help to keep Chow and owner happy and healthy, and doing activities together enhances the human-canine bond.",
        "training": "Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Chow grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion. Patience and positive, consistent reinforcement are the keys to successful training. The Chow Chow is a very intelligent dog but can be stubborn. Harsh training methods are to be avoided in order to develop a trusting relationship. Patience, praise, and regular practice are the best tools to use with your Chow.",

This slender but rugged hunter\u2019s coat ranges from light to dark tan or chestnut. The large, upright ears point up the alert expression of the eyes, whose amber or ochre color smartly complements the coat.\nIn many ways, these lithe and leggy Sicilians are typical sighthounds: sweet-natured, independent and, of course, breathtakingly swift.

His ears should be regularly inspected for dirt or buildup of excess wax and cleaned if needed with soft gauze and an ear-cleaning solution\u2014the dog\u2019s breeder or the veterinarian can recommend a good brand to use.

He does best when he has a function, whether that means competing in the show ring or other canine events or being an interactive family member. He enjoys long walks and activities with his people. Because of his strong hunting instincts, he should not be allowed off lead in areas that are not securely enclosed, as he may not be able to resist the urge to run off after perceived prey. He does well with a fenced backyard where he can enjoy playtime with his owner, although he should not be just left alone outside with no attention for long periods, as he would be lonely and unhappy.",

They respond well to gentle methods of training and can be successfully trained for obedience, rally, agility, tracking, and of course the breed\u2019s historical reason for existence: hunting. Many Cirnechi especially enjoy lure coursing. Due to the breed\u2019s strong prey drive, care must be exercised when introducing the Cirneco to cats and small animals. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the Cirneco grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion.",

Given excellent nutrition, regular veterinary care, parasite control, and the mental and physical stimulation he needs, he will be a happy and long-lived companion. Every week the owner should do a quick check of the dog\u2019s ears for any signs of infection, and the Cirneco\u2019s teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs."

A high-quality dog food appropriate to his age (puppy, adult, or senior) should have all the nutrients the breed needs. If your vet thinks your dog is becoming overweight, you may need to feed a low-calorie dog food. Clumbers are very food oriented. If you use treats while training, do so in moderation. Never feed cooked bones or fatty table foods.",
        "grooming": "As with all breeds with heavy, lowset ears, routine cleaning of the ears is a must to avoid ear infections. The heavy folds on the head require regular once-overs with a damp cloth. Wrinkles that are not kept dry can easily set up a yeast infection that has a bad odor and is unpleasant for the dog. Nails should be kept short with monthly trims. Bathing once a month is usually sufficient for a dog who isn\u2019t working regularly in the field. Clumbers don\u2019t require a lot of trimming; their coat is very easy care, requiring little more than a thorough grooming with a brush and a medium comb once or twice a week.",

These traits can sometimes make them a challenge to train, because they tend to stop and think things through before deciding to do them.

Like many other large breeds, growing too rapidly can cause eosinophilic panosteitis in Clumber puppies\u2014something they usually outgrow. Hip dysplasia also occurs in the breed. Because the Clumber body is quite long, they are also somewhat predisposed to intervertebral disc disease (cervical and thoracic).

Maintain proper weight, but be careful not to overfeed. Groomers and veterinarians often see overweight Cockers.",
        "grooming": "Cocker Spaniels require regular, thorough grooming. Sessions missed are not easily made up and may result in tangles or mats in the Cocker\u2019s coat. A metal, professional-quality dog comb with fine and medium spacing for the teeth is a necessity. You can follow combing with a gentle slicker brush, but the comb is key. Loose hair should be carefully removed with the comb, making sure you are clear and can see through to the skin everywhere. If you encounter snarls, do not pull through; rather, pick snarls apart, starting at the tips of the coat and then comb through. Be cautious when combing ears; the skin at the edges is thin and can be pierced by too-vigorous combing. The Cocker requires thorough bathing with quality dog shampoo. Thorough rinsing and re-rinsing are crucial, as soap residue can cause skin irritation. Dry carefully with a blow-dryer on not too hot a setting. Learn the procedure for cleaning and drying the ear canals. During bathing, check the Cocker\u2019s skin for any inflamed spots and get treatment.

They very much enjoy spending time with their people, so walking is a good exercise option. If the Cocker has a canine companion, they can play to exercise each other.

Collies do well on a good-quality dog food that is primarily meat-based, with fewer grains as ingredients. Many breed experts feel that Collies should not be fed foods with corn or soy in the ingredients. Collies have a risk of bloat, so two feedings/multiple feedings per day as opposed to once a day is recommended, and some meat added to the food has been shown to reduce risk.",
        "grooming": "Smooth Collies, while they won\u2019t mat, require regular grooming, as they have a double coat, and the undercoat needs brushing out during shedding periods. Rough Collies need attention to avoid matting, especially in certain areas such as behind the ears and elbows, and to remove loose undercoat. A weekly brushing down to the skin eliminates that problem and keeps the coat and skin healthy. If females are spayed, they do a big shed once a year; if intact, females shed about three months after their heat cycle, and males around their birthday, so those times require a little extra grooming.",
        "exercise": "While there are variations among individuals and families, Collies generally are quite active and require regular exercise. They need aerobic exercise and the chance to be able to run and play. Teaching them to fetch can provide good exercise, and having a fenced yard where they can run and going on daily walks help too.

Some Collies may also have a sensitivity to certain drugs, known as the MDR1 mutation. More information can be found on this at http://vcpl.vetmed.wsu.edu. Collies typically live from 12 to 14 years and are as a rule healthy, but after doing their research prospective buyers should ask questions of breeders and have an understanding of what health guarantees can be provided.",

During shedding season a rake-type grooming tool with metal prongs is good at removing the dead hair, then the coat can be scissored down. The majority of owners never brush a Curly-Coated Retriever, as then the coat frizzes. A wet-down and air-dry is easy to do and often will enhance the curls.

        "training": "The owner of a Curly-Coated Retriever needs to be firm but kind in training of the dog. Too rough, and they will turn tail; too soft or unclear, and they will not pay attention. They are an intelligent breed and smart enough to need an owner who is smarter than they are. Two things are helpful to remember regarding training a Curly: First, avoid too much repetition, as the dog may become bored and lose interest. Also, it is important for an owner to try to make the learning situation as much fun as possible. The goal is to make it so that the Curly enjoys what is being taught. Some Curlies do very well in the obedience ring, but for some the repetition of some of the exercises can cause disinterest. Training for fieldwork takes a knowledgeable approach and should not be rough. When new to the breed and interested in starting field training, find a training group in your area with whom you can train, and observe their methods before deciding to join.",

This\u00a0exercise can consist of chasing a ball tossed across the backyard, running alongside a biking or jogging owner, or taking a nice, long hike through the woods. Since a puppy\u2019s bones and joints aren\u2019t at their mature strength until two years of age, be wary of strenuously exercising the dog before then.

If he understands that new places and people are nothing to be afraid of, it will not only make his life happier but will make life with him much easier for you. He should be taught to behave from the very beginning, but Dalmatians can be very sensitive, so positive, reward-based training is a must.

A unilaterally hearing dog (deaf in one ear) can usually lead a fairly normal life; a bilaterally (both sides) deaf dog often cannot and will require special considerations. Kidney stones are also present in Dals. Your breeder or vet can tell you what you should feed to avoid the problem.

        "Blurb": "\n            This breed is pronounced da'rinse-ah puh'trice-hoon. The Drentsche Patrijshond, Drent for short,\u00a0is not your typical continental pointer. For starters, the Drent has a tail and is nearly four hundred years old. The Drent was built by farmers for farmers. As a farm dog, Drents had to do it all: hunt feather and fur, keep the farm clear of vermin, cart dairy to the market and much more. The breed has maintained versatility from the beginning and are highly intelligent and adaptable. As such, training must be kept lively and interesting. Drents are used in all types of hunting, agility, tracking, dog sledding, and skijoring.\n        ",
        "nutrition": "The DPCNA recommends following the recommended guidelines of a high-quality dry food and to make adjustments in quantity only as needed (e.g. increase in activity should correspond with an increase in feed provided.) Drents don\u2019t require specialized diets. Some are capable of self-feeding whereas others will eat for as long as there is food available.\u00a0Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.",
        "grooming": "The coat of the Drent is considered the be \u201chalf-long\u201d, meaning hair on the body is short of a full curl to nearly flat, but has feathering on the neck, back of all legs, and a brushy tail. Drents have a single coat, like Setters and Brittanys and shed twice per year. Managing the seasonal change is generally handled with a comb, followed by a pin brush, finished with a boar bristle brush. Use the comb to loosen and get the bulk of the hair, which is ready to come out. Follow with the pin brush; it\u2019ll do a nice job of sweeping up the rest. At this point you are likely to see dander, and so enters the boar brush. The boar bristles will clean that up, and will help distribute the natural oils and get the coat nice and shiny. If the bristles whiten, take the brush outdoors and pat/rub the bristles on a stone \u2013 that is all dander you don\u2019t want in your house. This is also great for people who are allergic to dogs, as they are technically allergic to the dander on the dog. By reducing the dander on the dog, it makes the dog easier and more pleasant to be around. Usually a brief weekly grooming session handles everything pretty well. Between shedding seasons, you might be able to skip it for a few weeks, if your Drent doesn\u2019t carry the brush up to you for the attention.",
        "exercise": "Drents are intelligent hunting dogs in need of stimulation and regular exercise, regardless of the weather. They are wonderful hiking partners, but also suitable for canicross, or any of the \u201cjoring\u201d sports. The Drent also would be good for agility, or other \u201caction\u201d sport where mind and body are engaged. This breed is not suitable for sedentary lifestyles.",
        "training": "The Drent is known to be obedient, loyal and attentive, but on occasion, they can be stubborn and self-thinking. These intelligent dogs bore with monotonous and repetitious activities. Possibly the Drent\u2019s greatest attribute is his strong and innate eagerness to please his boss. Due to the Drents slow emotional development and at times obstinate character, a benevolent handler is necessary with a good sense of humor. The playfulness and enthusiasm that can make the Drent easy to train are the very same qualities that can require training to take a long time to get to exam level obedience. While the standard states that the dog is \u201cnaturally obedient\u201d, please don\u2019t think this breed can go without training. The time and energy invested will prove to be well worth the effort.",
        "health": "In broad strokes, the Drent is a healthy breed. Certainly some individuals may suffer from any canine malady, but that isn\u2019t representative across the breed as a common issue or health concern. From a genetic standpoint, the Drent has only a few hereditary diseases to know about and monitor in order to keep incidences low.\nThe Drent\u2019s eyes should be monitored for the following hereditary diseases: Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), Distichiasis, Entropion and Ectropion, Persistent Pupillay Membranes (PPM), and Retinal Dysplasisa. Other diseases or abnormalities which have been found in the Drent are: hemophilia, hypothyroidism, cryptorchidism, hyperuricosuria, significant reactions to poisonous insect bites/stings and the absence of certain teeth.\nLike many breeds, hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia should be monitored and all breeding stock screened for. Joint dysplasia is influenced by genetics and environment, so using care during the Drents\u2019 rapid growth period is advisable.\nAmongst breed authorities, Epilepsy is considered to be the greatest current health threat to the Drent. Still, incidence rates remain undocumented and unverified; the locus of the disease in the Drent has not been located.\nThe most common, but usually non-problematic, is von Willebrand disease type-I (vWD-I). Despite a high incidence rate of carriers and affected dogs in the population, Drents do not present the disease in clinical terms, despite what modern science has to say about the issue. Paw Print Genetics has studied this phenomenon and their findings were validated by Cornell University. Von Willebrand disease type-I is detectable by the Paw Print Genetics DNA health panel. While the disease is of interest, it is considered to be of little threat for the Drent, yet the DPCNA is striving to lower the incidence rate in the North American population.",

Low-hanging ears such as the Foxhound\u2019s can be prone to infection, so the ears should be checked regularly. The teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.

The merry English Setter is known as the gentleman of the dog world but is game and boisterous at play. English Setters get on well with other dogs and people.

Overall appearance, balance, gait, and purpose to be given more emphasis than any component part. Above all, extremes of anything distort type and must be faulted.\n",
        "nutrition": "English Setter puppies should be fed small amounts three times a day. Once the dog is a year old, feeding a good-quality dog food twice a day is ideal. Keep in mind that English Setters can easily overeat and become obese, so you\u2019ll need to monitor your dog\u2019s diet his entire life to make sure he maintains a healthy weight. And the breed loves to \u201ccounter surf\u201d\u2014try to not leave tempting food items within reach, and use positive training to discourage the behavior.

        "grooming": "To keep their long, silky coats beautiful, English Setters need to be brushed at least once a week with a soft bristle brush. A long-toothed metal dog comb can also come in handy for gently working through areas where tangles may be beginning to form. Left unattended, tangles and mats are uncomfortable for your dog and can cause skin problems to develop. Regular trimming around the face, feet, and other areas can keep your English Setter looking neat.\u00a0Nails\u00a0should be trimmed once a month, and a\u00a0bath\u00a0every four to six weeks keeps the English Setter\u2019s coat and skin clean and healthy.",
        "exercise": "An English Setter needs regular exercise to stay happy and healthy. Ideally this could be a daily vigorous run or play session in a large, securely fenced area. Many owners don\u2019t have access to such an area, however, so they may ride a bicycle with their English Setter alongside on a leash, jog with him, or take him for long walks or hikes. Because their bones and joints may not reach mature strength until two years of age, it\u2019s best to avoid very strenuous or high-impact activity with puppies and young dogs. Even though they are energetic athletes when outdoors, English Setters will usually settle right down as quiet companions in the home after their daily run or walk.",
        "training": "English Setters are sensible, good-natured, and devoted companions. They are very sensitive and take reprimands to heart, so it\u2019s best to teach them with positive reinforcement rather than punishment. Their keen nose and prey drive can lead them to follow their instincts\u2014but this can get them into trouble, so it\u2019s important to start\u00a0training early\u00a0and be consistent. As puppies they\u2019re especially curious about everything, so remember to keep valuable or dangerous items out of reach. When given the attention, training, and exercise he needs, an English Setter is wonderfully companionable and pleasantly manageable in the home.",

The Springer can be trimmed by the owner or taken to a professional groomer for clipping and neatening-up of the coat, particularly the feet, the areas around the head and neck, and under the tail.

Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your pet. Their strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.",

In inclement weather, indoor activities like\u00a0chasing a ball rolled along the floor or teaching him new tricks can be good ways to expend energy. This breed, as indicated by his past, needs space and freedom to roam and is not suitable for apartment living. If not given adequate stimulation, he will become destructive in the home.\u00a0Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise and mental stimulation.",

        "About": "\nThe French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect \u201cbat ears\u201d that are the breed\u2019s trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular.\nThe bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don\u2019t bark much\u2014but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by this vastly amusing and companionable breed.\n",
        "Facts": [
            "It is fairly well established that one of the ancestors of the French Bulldog is, not surprisingly, the English Bulldog (most likely one of the toy variety).",
            "Originally called the Boule-Dog Francais, though the english later scoffed at the idea of calling an English dog by a French name.",
            "The first specialty club was the French Bulldog Club of America, and fanciers gave a specialty show at the Waldorf-Astoria in NYC in 1898, the first specialty show to be held in such quarters. Receiving serious press coverage, Frenchies were thrust into vogue, reaching a peak in 1913 with an entry of 100 at the Westminster Kennel Club.",
            "Two distinctive features of the French Bulldog are its bat ears and half-flat, half-domed skull.",
            "Had it not been for the objections of American fanciers, the bat ear of the French Bulldog would have been bred out of the breed and replaced with a rose ear, resulting in a miniaturized version of the English Bulldog.",
            "While bred primarily as pets and companions, Frenchies are remarkably intelligent and serve as good watchdogs."

        "Blurb": "\n            The one-of-a-kind French Bulldog, with his large bat ears and even disposition, is one of the world\u2019s most popular small-dog breeds, especially among city dwellers. The Frenchie is playful, alert, adaptable, and completely irresistible.\n        ",
        "General_apperance": "The French Bulldog has the appearance of an active, intelligent, muscular dog of heavy bone, smooth coat, compactly built, and of medium or small structure. Expression alert, curious, and interested. Any alteration other than removal of dewclaws is considered mutilation and is a disqualification. Proportion and Symmetry \u2013 All points are well distributed and bear good relation one to the other; no feature being in such prominence from either excess or lack of quality that the animal appears poorly proportioned.\n",
        "nutrition": "A high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the breed needs. Frenchies are prone to obesity, which can damage their physical structure and puts them at higher risk for some of the breed\u2019s health issues, so it is vital to watch their calorie intake and weight. If you choose to give your dog treats, do so in moderation. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods high in fat. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet.",
        "grooming": "The Frenchie\u2019s short coat sheds minimally. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will help to remove shed hair and keep him looking his best. Brushing promotes new hair growth and distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy. A Frenchie\u2019s facial folds should be kept clean and dry. The Frenchie\u2019s nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause him pain.",
        "exercise": "A short walk or outdoor play session with their owner each day should provide enough exercise to keep the French Bulldog in shape. Frenchies enjoy participating in canine sports such as obedience, agility, and rally. As a flat-faced breed, however, they are prone to breathing difficulties and should never be allowed to exert themselves in hot or humid weather.",
        "training": "Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations will help him develop into a well-adjusted adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process, promote good behavior, and help the owner learn to recognize and correct bad habits. Frenchies have big personalities and can need a fair amount of training to make them civilized companions. They can be stubborn, but at heart they\u2019re people pleasers and therefore easy to train. The proper motivation (such as food) and making a game of the process will ensure their cooperation.",
        "health": "Because of their front-heavy structure, Frenchies cannot swim and should never be left unattended near a tub, pool, or body of water. Like all flat-faced breeds, Frenchies are prone to breathing problems and do poorly in hot or humid weather. Flat-faced breeds are also more sensitive to anesthesia. Frenchies occasionally have eye conditions such as cherry eye, juvenile cataracts, or entropion, and skin allergies and autoimmune skin disorders also are known to occur. A responsible breeder will take advantage of available tests to screen breeding stock for conditions that can affect the breed.",

The dog is neither unduly small nor conspicuously large. It gives the impression of medium size, but is like the proper hunter, \u201cwith a short back, but standing over plenty of ground.\u201d Symmetry and field quality are most essential.\n",
        "nutrition": "Feed a high-quality dog food that is appropriate to the dog\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior) and activity level. A pup under 6 months old will need to be fed more than twice a day; once the GSP reaches adulthood, a meal morning and evening should be sufficient. Because the breed is subject to bloat, they should not be fed immediately after running or other vigorous exercise, nor should they be allowed to run or exercise for at least an hour after eating and drinking. The ideal evening mealtime would be after physical activities are through for the day.",
        "grooming": "The GSPs coat is easy to groom most of the year, requiring only a good once-over with a brush or grooming glove every few days. Although the coat is short, it still sheds\u2014especially at certain times of the year, when more frequent brushing will be needed to remove the loose hairs before they end up all over the house. The hairs can become embedded in fabrics and carpet and hard to get out. An occasional bath (using a gentle shampoo) can help. The ears  should be regularly inspected and cleaned, and the nails trimmed short.",
        "exercise": "The GSP does best with plenty of exercise and things to do, such as running, swimming, and dog sports\u2014in fact, anything that will burn some of their boundless energy while spending time outdoors with a human buddy. Their routine should ideally include ample physical activity twice a day. This might be in the form of brisk, half-hour walks morning and evening or running and playing in a securely fenced area. GSPs are smart and athletic and excel in a wide range of canine activities that exercise mind and body, from field events to agility, obedience, and dock diving.",
        "training": "Early training is essential for the German Shorthaired Pointer. Socialization and puppy training classes are vital, continuing with practice in basic obedience commands. This is an intelligent breed that learns quickly with consistent training sessions. GSPs need a purpose, and without one they can be destructive if left to their own devices. The breed can be extremely challenging from 6 months to 3 years old. GSPs have a very high energy level and a strong prey drive, and they need an owner with an active lifestyle to guide the dog\u2019s exuberance and intensity into positive outlets.",
        "health": "Although German Shorthaired Pointers are generally healthy, there are some conditions the breed may be prone to. Among these are hip dysplasia, eye conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy, and certain heart diseases. A responsible breeder will screen their breeding stock for conditions that affect the breed. GSPs can also be affected by bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach suddenly distends and often twists as well.

Particularly impressive is his strong, mane-like collar around his neck, called a ruff, and the bushy tail carried boldly over his back. His foxy head, alert eyes, and small, pointed, closely-set ears give the German Spitz his unique cheeky appearance. His coat comes in a variety of colors including white, black, cream, gold, black and tan, sable, and chocolate brown. Though easily trainable, this lively and intelligent breed can also have an independent streak. If properly trained (so as not to be too noisy) and well socialized, the German Spitz will be happy mingling with other people and dogs.\n",

Many dog food companies have breed-specific formulas for small, medium, large and extra-large breeds. The German Spitz is a small breed.",
        "grooming": "The German Spitz has a profuse double coat, which sheds twice per year. During those times, the entire undercoat is shed in the span of about 2 to 3 weeks. Daily brushing will be required to remove his old coat and his hair will inevitably be all over your clothes, furniture and floor. The good news is his shedding is quite minimal during the rest of the year. A quick brush every couple days and a thorough grooming once per week will suffice to keep mats and knots from forming. His hair should never be clipped off entirely, as you will remove the insulating properties of his coat. He also does not need to be bathed very often. Mud can be brushed out of his coat if allowed to dry first.",
        "exercise": "A moderate amount of regular exercise will suffice for the German Spitz. Though longer activity is unnecessary, he will happily keep up on an extended walk. Providing a secure area for exercise is highly recommended as he is a very curious dog and can wiggle through the smallest of gaps in search for other adventures. Ponds are also a hazard to this breed and should be fenced off.\u00a0Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching him new tricks.\u00a0If you live in an apartment, even short walks in the hallways can give your dog some exercise, especially during inclement weather.",
        "training": "Highly intelligent, the German Spitz learns quickly and is eager to please with motivational methods. He does not respond well to being made to do things however. One behavioral characteristic you may want to curb with training is his natural reaction to bark at anything new or unusual. Bred to be an alert watchdog, he is naturally very vocal, but this should not be allowed to become a problem. Your neighbors will not thank you for it either. With good training, this breed can excel at mini agility heelwork to music and obedience.",
        "health": "Some cases of PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), RD (Retinal Dysplasia), and Patella Luxation have been seen in the German Spitz, but a majority of this breed are generally healthy.

Owners should prevent puppies from jumping off couches, going down steep stairs, or engaging in anything that might put undue stress on their growing front legs and joints. Pups need time for the growth plates in their legs to close before they do any jumping or start climbing or descending stairs. Going down stairs is more stressful on the front legs than going up. Some breeders have pups avoid stairs and jumping as much as possible until they are at least 9 months of age, as the growth plates will close sometime between 9 and 12 months.

They can live in an apartment but if so, they need daily exercise, which can be met by walking, jogging, or biking with the dog. If they have a yard in which to run, they will self-exercise, though a Gordon will always be happiest doing something with their bonded owner. Being with their owner is what they live to do. Caution: To prevent bloat, never exercise the dog one-half hour before or one-half hour after feeding.",

They are very smart and learn quickly. The best training is for them to have a job to do, and the best job they can have is spending time with their owner\u2014whether being trained or having fun.

Well, standing as high as 28.5 inches and weighing as much as a midsize human, a Greater Swiss might easily be greater than you.\nSwissies are immensely strong, yet agile enough to move a flock across the sloping foot of a mountain. The coat is a striking tricolor\u2014black, red, and white. The head and muzzle typically have a white marking (the \u201cblaze\u201d), setting off a sweet expression. Several big mountain-dog breeds are described as \u201cmajestic,\u201d but Swissies practically invented the word.\n",
        "Facts": [
            "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a relatively new AKC breed, fully recognized in 1995.",
            "The Greater Swiss is one of four types of Sennenhund breeds developed in Switzerland as a herding, guard, and utilitarian draft dog.",

            "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog was introduced in the United States when J. Frederick and Patricia Hoffman saw the breed at a show in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1967. The following year the Hoffmans, along with Perrin G. Rademacher, imported the first Swissy into this country."

        "Blurb": "\n            The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a large, immensely strong worker famous for a dense coat of striking black, red, and white markings. Dependable and faithful Swissies earned their feed as herders, drafters, and all-around pasture dogs.\n        ",
        "General_apperance": "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a Draft and Drover breed and should structurally appear as such. It is a striking, tri-colored, large, powerful, confident dog of sturdy appearance. It is a heavy boned and well muscled dog which, in spite of its size and weight, is agile enough to perform the all-purpose farm duties of the mountainous regions of its origin.\n",
        "nutrition": "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog can thrive on many types of diet, from kibble to raw to a combination of both. The most serious issue with feeding the GSMD is overfeeding, which leads to many digestive problems, including loose stools, and also leads to obesity, which is one of the greatest health problems in the breed.",
        "grooming": "This is basically a \u201cwash and wear\u201d breed, but they are double coated and do blow their undercoat, usually twice a year. When this is occurring they benefit from a good bath and blow-out, followed by a thorough brushing with a rake or shedding tool. For the rest of the year the occasional bath and brushing usually does the trick. They need regular nail-trims and ear and teeth cleaning.",
        "exercise": "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog requires moderate exercise. A walk around the block or a romp in the woods generally will satisfy their daily exercise needs. This breed is much better suited for the person looking for a hiking companion than the person wanting a bicycling or marathon-running partner.",
        "training": "The GSMD is very food motivated and responds well to training using food rewards. They can also have a stubborn streak, however, so their owners must be more determined than they are. It is not recommended to use any harness-type training device on this breed. They are a draft breed, and the use of a harness (other than for draft work) just tends to make them pull that much harder. As with all dogs, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended.",
        "health": "The GSMD does not have any breed-specific disorders but can have health problems that affect large-breed dogs. This can include orthopedic issues, although overall the GSMD\u2019s orthopedics tend to be very good for a large breed. Splenic torsion, unrelated to gastric torsion, occurs more often in this breed than in other breeds. Owners should be aware of the possibility of bloat and know the symptoms, and what to do should it occur. Urinary incontinence is fairly common in puppies and spayed bitches. Epilepsy can occur in any pedigree; genetic markers for this have not yet been identified. Overall the GSMD tends to be a very healthy breed.

Eyes are dark, bright, intelligent, indicating spirit.\n",
        "nutrition": "Feed the Greyhound a high-quality dog food\u00a0appropriate to his age (puppy, adult, or senior).

        "grooming": "The Greyhound\u2019s short, smooth coat requires little grooming beyond regular baths and weekly rubdowns with a damp cloth or hound glove. His strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort. The ears should be checked at least weekly for any buildup of wax or debris that could result in an infection, and cleaned if needed. The teeth should be brushed regularly\u2014daily if possible\u2014with a toothpaste formulated for dogs.",
        "exercise": "The Greyhound is the cheetah of the dog world. While perfectly happy to lounge around the house all day, he is capable of amazing speed and energy when faced with potential prey\u2014or the chance to chase a tennis ball or a coursing lure. Greyhounds require a regular schedule of exercise time and opportunities to (safely) run full-out. They must only be allowed off leash in a securely fenced area, as they may not be able to resist the urge to run off in pursuit of perceived prey.",
        "training": "Training a Greyhound can be frustrating for anyone who does not understand the genetic origins of the Greyhound temperament. As a sighthound, or coursing breed, the Greyhound was developed to pursue game by sight rather than by scent. They course game independently of humans, making decisions on their own, unlike other types of hunting breeds that require a bit of direction. A Greyhound should be socialized from an early age with small animals and children. Keep training lessons short and sweet, as the Greyhound will become bored very easily. With his mild, sensitive personality, he needs a gentle approach in training, never harsh. Greyhounds are more interested in doing things *with* you than *for* you. They are very affectionate with their families, though they tend to be reserved with strangers.",
        "health": "Greyhounds are overall very healthy dogs, although there are a few conditions the breed can be prone to. As are most deep-chested breeds, the Greyhound is susceptible to bloat and gastric torsion, a sudden and life-threatening enlargement of the stomach that is sometimes accompanied by twisting. Owners should be aware of the symptoms of bloat and seek medical attention immediately if they occur. A condition called Greyhound neuropathy seems to be isolated in the breed. Other disorders that can occur include cardiac and eye conditions. Responsible breeders screen their stock for conditions that can affect the breed.",

Unlike most scent hounds though, the Hamiltonstovare has an extremely high prey drive for both scent and sight. They can make excellent lure coursing dogs. In the home, they are a lazy, low maintenance dog who rarely sheds. Very food motivated, they can be easy to train despite their hound stubbornness, but higher competitive obedience levels are not usually an option. The only major problem with this breed is accessibility; there is only one breeder of\u00a0Hamiltonstovare in the United States.\u00a0Unfortunately, Hamiltonstovare have a rescue problem in the US as well, and some can be found in rural shelters in Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\u00a0\nClub Contact Details\nClub: Hamiltonstovare\u00a0Club of America\nName:\u00a0Ashley Hammock\nEmail:\u00a0OceaniaHamilton@hotmail.com\nAddress:\u00a02311 Chapel Hill Rd, Goochland, Va 23063\n",

Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet.",
        "grooming": "The long, soft, and silky coat of the Havanese needs to be groomed daily to be kept free of mats and tangles. This can be done by gently running a comb or soft brush over the dog while he is on your lap. Pet owners often choose to have their dog\u2019s coat clipped to a short trim to reduce grooming time. The Havanese should also be bathed occasionally as needed. The corners of the eyes should be gently cleaned daily to prevent tear-stain of the lighter-colored hair in the area. Check the ears often to remove excess wax or accumulated debris, and wipe out the inside of the ear-flap with a slightly moistened gauze or paper towel.",
        "exercise": "The Havanese has moderate exercise needs. They will benefit from a brisk daily walk or a fun playtime with their owner in the backyard, as they are happiest when someone is with them. Romping inside the home can also provide enough activity. Never over-exercise a Havanese of any age. If they are panting and struggling to keep up, it is time to go home. Havanese do well in both houses and apartments, but they are not happy left alone for hours at a time.",
        "training": "Havanese are highly intelligent and eager to please, and they are easily trained so long as you use only positive methods. This can be a sensitive breed, so care must be taken to not scold them harshly. Socialization from an early age is very important. Expose them calmly to a wide variety of new places and new people, always ensuring that the experiences are positive and not intimidating. Gentle, patient training will result in a wonderful companion dog. They are affectionate with people and get along with other nonaggressive pets.",
        "health": "Havanese are generally healthy and fairly long-lived. There are several conditions that the breed can be prone to, including eye disorders, chondrodysplasia, deafness, heart murmurs, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (which affects the hip joint), and patellar luxation. A responsible breeder does health clearances on all breeding stock. The Havanese Club of America presents awards for members\u2019 dogs passing and registering Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) results for at least four specific health tests for the breed: an annual eye exam (CAER), a hearing test (BAER), a hip x-ray, and patella (knee) certification.",

They are incredibly intelligent thinkers and problem solvers, and they excel at tasks given to them. If not socialized properly, however, Hokkaido can become wary of strangers and protective of their families.\u00a0The breed is extremely rare outside its native country.

What you feed your dog is an individual choice, but working with your veterinarian and/or breeder will be the best way to determine frequency of meals as a puppy and the best adult diet to increase his longevity. Properly fed Hokkaido should have thick, shiny coats and clean teeth. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.",
        "grooming": "The Hokkaido is a fairly self-managed breed. The natural oils on their skin and coat help to keep them clean and dry despite unfavorable weather conditions. No trimming or shaving of their fur is required or recommended, just regular brushing to remove dead fur and keep the coat healthy. Hokkaido blow their undercoat roughly twice yearly. During this time, a bath and frequent brushing to remove the dead fur is necessary. Their nails should be trimmed regularly to avoid overgrowth and cracking. Teeth should be brushed regularly.",

Without proper physical and mental stimulation, Hokkaido can become bored, anxious, and hyperactive in your home. If letting your Hokkaido run in your backyard, you should have a six foot fence, as they are good jumpers. For daily walks, a strong leash and a properly fitted martingale collar or harness is recommended.",

Hokkaido are prone to collie eye anomaly, hip dysplasia, luxating patella, heart murmurs, idiopathic seizures, anxiety, psychogenic polydipsia, and pica. When living with a Hokkaido, it is important to monitor them frequently to make sure they are not chewing on items which can cause them harm.

They come in three colors: blonde, black and tan, and black. They are alert, faithful, trustworthy, extremely intelligent, fun-loving, and stubborn. A Hovawart likes to have a job to do, or he will use his creative nature to find one. They take approximately two years to mature. Currently, Hovawarts in North America are participating in search and rescue organizations, therapy dog activities, obedience trials, agility trials, flyball and service dog training. Owning a Hovawart can be quite a challenge, and they require significant time and attention from their owners, so they are not recommended for first-time dog owners. However, for an owner who is willing to expend the effort to teach their dog appropriate behaviors in different situations, the reward is a faithful companion. The Hovawart is a family dog. It develops a strong bond to its \u201cpack\u201d and must be a part of the family life; it needs to bond closely with the owner/family.\u00a0 If it has been well integrated into the family, it does not mind spending the occasional hour in a kennel.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nClub Contact Details\nClub: Hovawart Club of North America\nEmail:\u00a0info@hovawartclub.org\n",

        "grooming": "Because the Hovawart does not have much of an undercoat, it does not need much grooming. Apart from the period of shedding, an occasional brushing will suffice.\u00a0Beyond this, the occasional bath will keep them clean and looking their best. Their strong fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.",

It is preferable to have a large fenced yard, but substitute exercises such as hiking, trips to a dog park, etc. can make up for some lack in this area. It needs at least a one-hour walk, plus 3 or 4 shorter walks to do \u201cits business\u201d daily.\u00a0Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally can also be a great way to give your dog exercise. Apartments are not typically large enough, or have room enough, for the desired activities.",
        "training": "The Hovawart\u2019s guarding instincts are best controlled by socialization and exposure to different situations and stimuli. This will allow the dog to understand how each situation should be approached and utilizes the dog\u2019s intelligence to assure a measured response. Absent directions, the Hovawart will make his own decision, and it may not match what you want him to do. Training is needed so the dog understands how you want it to make decisions and not rely on its instincts. Appropriate guarding instincts are a learned process, and the dogs need to be educated by exposing them to these situations.",

It is important that the breed look as natural as possible, although scissors or clippers might be used to tidy up the rough edges just for the sake of neatness. An all-over grooming once a week with a soft brush and a slicker or comb to eliminate any tangles will keep the dog looking his best. The ears should be checked weekly for any excess wax and debris. A bath every month or so is usually sufficient. Nails should be trimmed every few weeks, as needed.",

His intelligence, energy, and devotion to his human make him a natural at obedience, hunting, tracking, and agility.",

The occasional\u00a0table scrap\u00a0won\u2019t hurt, but don\u2019t let those pleading eyes get away with persuading you to give too many or offer too many treats.

            "It took a national political turnover in Holland to bring the Keeshond to wide attention in the latter part of the 18th century. Holland was split between the partisans of the Prince of Orange and the Patriots, and the Patriots (principally the bourgeoisie) were led by Kees de Gyselaer, who owned a dog named Kees. Kees gave the Keeshond breed its name and became the symbol of the Patriots.",

        "Blurb": "\n            The amiable Keeshond is a medium-sized spitz dog of ample coat, famous for the distinctive \u201cspectacles\u201d on his foxy face. Once a fixture on the canal barges of his native Holland, the Kees was, and remains, a symbol of Dutch patriotism.\n        ",
        "General_apperance": "The Keeshond (pronounced kayz-hawnd) is a natural, handsome dog of well-balanced, short-coupled body, attracting attention not only by his coloration, alert carriage, and intelligent expression, but also by his stand-off coat, his richly plumed tail well curled over his back, his foxlike expression, and his small pointed ears. His coat is very thick around the neck, fore part of the shoulders and chest, forming a lion-like ruff-more profuse in the male. His rump and hind legs, down to the hocks, are also thickly coated, forming the characteristic \u201ctrousers.\u201d His head, ears, and lower legs are covered with thick, short hair.\n",

Most Kees have very good appetites! Treats are a great training aid with Kees, as the breed is very food motivated, but too many can make the dog overweight. Owners need to vigilant about weight and snacks. Females should weigh between 25 and 29 pounds, and males should not weigh more than 39 pounds.",
        "grooming": "Keeshonden do require regular grooming, but going through their coats once a week with a pin brush usually does the job. This will keep the undercoat brushed out, and keeps shedding to a minimum. The only trimming needed is tidying around the feet, pads, and hocks. Pet owners can brush weekly and take their dogs to the groomer for a bath and blow-dry every four to six weeks, or they do it themselves. Show dogs are bathed a few days before the show weekend.",
        "exercise": "Keeshonden will adapt to many environments. Historically they have had homes ranging from farms with lots of space to run, to barges having little room to move around. They do need regular exercise and like being with their families. A free run or a nice walk daily will benefit them physically and mentally, and then they will be glad to climb up on the sofa with you while you read or watch TV. An essential thing to know about Kees is that they are happy dogs and will smile every day if you just spend time with them.",
        "training": "A well-kept secret is that Kees are very smart and highly trainable. They excel at obedience, where some of them are nationally ranked, as well as agility, where the first multiple MACH was a Keeshond named Molly. Many Kees have also distinguished themselves in therapy work. Kees learn things quickly and are motivated to please their trainers. However, the trainer has to keep up with them, as they can become bored. It is important to start with your Kees as a puppy between 10 and 14 weeks. They will learn fast and move to the next level. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Without training they will learn things, but not necessarily what you had in mind!",
        "health": "Keeshonden in general are a healthy, active breed that can live a happy life from 12 to 15 years of age. The Keeshond Club of America recommends certain health tests for every Keeshond before it is bred to help breeders identify any health concerns. These tests include X-rays to screen for hip and elbow dysplasia, an exam for patellar luxation, a CERF eye exam, and a genetic screen for primary hyperparathyroidism. Because the breed has been screened for these diseases by reputable breeders, the conditions have been reduced in the breed, and most Kees are free of them.

        "grooming": "A beautiful corded coat is the result of special care. An experienced breeder reports, \u201cWe never brush but do wash the dogs regularly. When the coat starts to clump or \u2018plate up\u2019 at 9 or 10 months, we start to split the clumps or plates into areas that grow out of an area on the skin about the size of a quarter. Those grow out into the cords. There is no reason for a corded coat to smell bad or be dirty. Bathing with dilute shampoo gets the job done. To finish the bath, make sure to rinse out every hint of the shampoo, and then dry by squeezing, using towels, and then in front of a strong fan overnight. If the coat doesn\u2019t get dry or has residual shampoo, it might smell badly.\u201d",

Free-running time in a large, securely fenced yard, going for walks, and playing with their housemate dogs all help a Komondor stay in shape. Dog parks are often a bad idea for Komondors. Developed as a livestock guardian breed, their guarding instincts can cause them to react badly to loose stranger dogs, or to the perception that a group of dogs might be a threatening pack.",

Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. The breed can be susceptible to bloat, or gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), where the stomach distends and twists. The causes of bloat aren\u2019t fully understood, but experts agree that multiple, small meals per day and preventing vigorous exercise around mealtimes may help reduce the chances of it happening.",
        "grooming": "The Kuvasz has a double coat, consisting of guard hair and fine undercoat. His coat is very easy to care for, needing only weekly brushing to remove debris and reduce shedding. Beyond that, an occasional bath will keep him clean and looking his best. His nails should be trimmed every month or so if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause him discomfort.",

While these qualities make them wonderful companions, they can also challenge the novice dog owner. Early socialization and puppy training classes are a must for the Kuvasz puppy. Training a Kuvasz takes patience, as this independent breed matures slowly. Sensistive problem-solvers, Kuvasz do not respond well to harsh or repetitive training techniques. The Kuvasz was bred to guard livestock, and he is a natural guardian and will protect family, house, and property.",

Although a healthy breed overall, there are some disorders that Kuvasz are prone to. Large and deep-chested breeds are susceptible to bloat, a sudden, life-threatening distention of the stomach that can be accompanied by twisting. Owners should learn what signs to look out for and what to do should they occur. Conditions that can affect the breed include elbow and hip dysplasia, autoimmune thyroiditis, patellar luxation, cardiac conditions, and progressive retinal atrophy.

Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of 7 weeks and 4 months and beginning obedience training early on will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult.

A male can stand over 31 inches at the shoulder and weigh as much as a full-grown human. Females run smaller but are still a whole lot of dog. Breed hallmarks include a medium-long waterproof coat, lush triangular ears, a bushy tail, and a black facemask that frames kindly dark-brown eyes. A dramatic feature of the male\u2019s coat is the lion-like mane around the neck and chest. A well-built Leo moves with an easy, elastic gait. A Leo is friendly but nobody\u2019s fool. As watchdogs and all-around workers, they exhibit intelligence and sound judgment. Leos require lots of brushing, ample room for romping, and unlimited love.\n",
        "Facts": [
            "Leonbergers come from the town of Leonberg, in modern day Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.",

            "Leonbergers have a double coat which requires regular brushing to help control the shedding, and is one of the few breeds in the AKC whose coat may not be altered or trimmed, except to \"neaten the feet.\"",
            "Leonbergers are most closely related to the St. Bernard and, to a lesser extent, to the Landseer Newfoundland and Pyrenean Mountain Dog.",

        "General_apperance": "Don\u2019t let his size and lion-like looks fool you; the Leonberger is a big bundle of love. Bred as farm dogs and family companions, Leonbergers are eager to please and, with their love of children, are wonderful family dogs. Because they respond so well to training, they also make excellent therapy dogs. Leonberger puppies grow up to be surprisingly graceful adult dogs, who will appreciate moderate exercise and some regular training. They are shedders, so you\u2019ll want to brush that double coat regularly.\n",
        "nutrition": "A high-quality brand of dog food appropriate to the Leo\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the breed needs. It is important to not overfeed the young Leonberger, as an overweightpuppy or young dog of large breeds especially can be more prone to developing structural problems. And as with humans, too many treats can lead to obesity. Be careful to avoid giving table scraps, and especially avoid cooked bones and foods with high fat content.",
        "grooming": "Leonbergers shed a lot\u2014and twice a year, they shed even more. A Leo should be brushed every day, especially in the areas of his body that tend to mat: the long hair behind the ears and on the backs of the legs. A more thorough grooming should be done once a week\u2014and given the breed\u2019s size, this will take a fair amount of time. Leos have a thick, full outer coat and a shorter, fluffier undercoat. A metal comb and an undercoat rake can be used to work out the undercoat, and a pin brush and a slicker brush will neaten up the outer coat. In addition, a Leo\u2019s nailsshould be trimmed every other week.",
        "exercise": "If you live in a city apartment or a house on a small, suburban lot, this may not be the breed for you. Adult Leonbergers are generally calm and subdued, but they still need to have some vigorous exercise once a day. Puppies and adolescents are active and exuberant. They can benefit from jogging or hiking with their owner or keeping pace alongside a bicycle. A large yard with a tall, strong fence is the ideal place for a Leo to run around. Remember, these are working dogs. Drafting\u2014that is, pulling a cart\u2014and agility training are two good ways for a Leo to get the activity he or she needs.",
        "training": "Leonbergers are very large and strong. In addition, puppies and adolescents have loads of energy and are extremely enthusiastic. With these facts in mind, proper training of the breed is essential. Leo puppies should be socialized by being gently exposed to a wide range of people, animals, and settings before the age of 20 weeks. Group obedience classes will help a Leo learn to be a well-mannered companion and canine citizen. A Leo is probably stronger than and may even outweigh his owner, and it is imperative that he learns to do what you want him to do.",
        "health": "As with all canines, proper exercise and nutrition, routine vet exams, and parasite prevention are keys to a happy and healthy life. Large dogs such as Leos can be prone to bloat,where the stomach twists and gas is trapped inside. Bloat can quickly be fatal, and it is important to know its signs, such as drooling, restlessness, enlarged abdomen, and attempts to vomit. If your breeder knows that bloat has occurred in your Leo\u2019s bloodline, consider the preventative measure of having your dog\u2019s stomach surgically tacked to the abdominal wall.",

Most Lhasas tend to utilize their food very well, and even slight overfeeding can lead to unpleasant digestive outcomes. Food can be fed dry, or slightly moistened with a little flavor enhancement such as cooked meat or a grain-free canned food. Whether to feed once or twice a day is a personal choice for owners, but dogs thrive on consistency, so it is recommended to keep the frequency and time of day constant.",
        "grooming": "Long hair or puppy cut? Both require regular maintenance, and this is a choice for the owner to make. Lhasas in a puppy cut or other clip still should be brushed regularly and bathed between visits to the groomer. Long hair requires regular brushing, using the right tools and techniques. Expect to bathe a long coat at least every two weeks, and brush at least once between baths. Thorough rinsing is essential, as shampoo residue irritates the skin. Conditioners and finishing sprays make grooming easier. Freshly bathed long or clipped hair should be thoroughly dried and brushed, as damp hair, even when clean, will mat.",

Most breed experts recommend that puppies start on an adult dog food formulation with a protein percentage no higher than 26 percent, and a calcium/phosphorous ratio of approx.1.2:1. Feeding scheduled meals is recommended, rather than free-feeding, to avoid excessive weight gain.",

However, owners must be careful not to overtax growing puppies and young adults: Don\u2019t allow them to run up and down stairs, jump from heights, or engage in long walks. Begin with no more than half a block for a 2- to 3-month-old puppy. Additionally, Mastiffs are notorious for plopping down during walks when they are tired or overheated.

Training tips include: (1) Make eye contact with your Mastiff; they communicate a great deal with their eyes, and they are excellent at reading your expressions and body language. (2) Use praise and positive rewards\u2014you can easily hurt their feelings by raising your voice. (3) Hold several short sessions during the day, keeping it fun and varied.

The Buhund has a lot of energy, strength and stamina. This self-appointed watchdog is also content lying at your feet at the end of the day.

Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with high fat content.

Buhunds do have a desire to please, but their independence is often stronger, which makes it challenging to maintain their focus and convince them to continue training. Fortunately most Buhunds are highly food-motivated, therefore positive training techniques such as clicker training work well. At the same time, most Buhunds are extremely sensitive to their environment, which makes them challenging in the ring.",

For that reason, when exercising their Norwegian Elkhounds, owners should resist the temptation to allow them to roam the neighborhood or the park off lead.

However, with today\u2019s wide variety of quality dog food options, it is generally not a problem to find a diet that agrees with your Toller.",
        "grooming": "Tollers require weekly brushing to keep their coat looking its best. During shedding season, daily brushing is often in order. Pay special attention to the coat around and under the ears, as in these areas it is finer and more likely to knot. Because Tollers should be presented as naturally as possible, minimal additional grooming is preferred, and this is generally limited to neatening the areas around the ears and feet. Special care should be taken to remove excess hair from between the pads of the feet, as this will help your Toller maintain traction on indoor surfaces. Attention should also be paid to trimming nails, preferably weekly.",
        "exercise": "Most Tollers have a medium to high energy level and are not generally content unless they are able to engage in some form of physical exercise on a daily basis. A brisk, 30-minute walk and/or a couple of ball-chasing sessions per day will suffice for many Tollers, though some will need more. Because Tollers are a breed who love to engage and do things with their owners, many Toller owners participate in sports such as agility, flyball, or fieldwork to channel the breed\u2019s excess energy. Engaging in these sports has the added benefit of strengthening the bond between owner and Toller.",
        "training": "Temperament-wise, Tollers are often a curious mixture of stubborn and soft. At times they seem to have the brain of a Chessie and the heart of a spaniel. These characteristics can make them challenging to train, as you don\u2019t always know whether they are \u201cputting one on over you.\u201d Most Tollers respond well to reward-based training. They generally want to know what\u2019s in it for them and enjoy \u201clearn to earn\u201d opportunities. They like training to be fun, so short, productive sessions are best. However, it is still important to have consequences for undesirable responses. As one Toller owner put it, \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to think they are living on a cruise ship.\u201d",
        "health": "Although Tollers are a relatively healthy breed, with a life expectancy of 12\u201314 years, there are some health issues that breeders are working to get a handle on. One issue is Addison\u2019s disease. Because this disease often doesn\u2019t surface until the dog is middle-aged, the dog may have already produced offspring by the time a diagnosis is made. Efforts to develop a gene-marker test for Addison\u2019s in the breed have been unsuccessful so far. Tollers also are somewhat more prone than many other breeds to develop autoimmune-related issues. Some of these conditions, like hypothyroidism, are relatively easy and inexpensive to treat, while others, like hemolytic anemia, can be life threatening.",

            "The Otterhound is a large breed of dog developed in England to hunt otter. The hunting of otters was practiced because they were preying on the fish in the rivers and streams. Otterhounds were used in packs to protect fishponds and control the otter population.",

It has an extremely sensitive nose, and is inquisitive and perseverant in investigating scents. The Otterhound hunts its quarry on land and water and requires a combination of characteristics unique among hounds-most notably a rough, double coat; and substantial webbed feet. Otterhounds should not be penalized for being shown in working condition (lean, well muscled, with a naturally stripped coat). Any departure from the following points should be considered a fault; its seriousness should be regarded in exact proportion to its degree.\n",
        "nutrition": "Otterhounds should be fed two meals a day. Many people feed grain-free kibble, but sometimes a working dog can use grain for energy and to avoid weight loss. Usually Otterhounds enjoy and do well on most high-quality foods. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet. Plenty of clean, fresh water should be available at all times.",
        "grooming": "While Otterhounds should be shown as naturally as possible, their coats do need brushing once or twice a week, depending on length and texture. A good slicker brush and medium comb work for this. The Otterhound\u2019s beard may need cleaning at the same time, since they tend to drag them on the ground and store snacks in them. Toe nails should be trimmed every week or two.",
        "exercise": "Otterhounds need mental as well as physical exercise. A large, securely fenced-in yard is a good beginning, but some hounds will lie under a tree in a fenced acre rather than self-exercise. Long walks to sniff the world and visit passers-by are good for both owners and hounds. Obedience classes, tracking, and agility all provide mental stimulation as well as good exercise.",

Like people, they love to be told how wonderful and talented they are when they master something. Be patient. Food usually works well in training, but the combination of food and praise together is even better. Clicker-training can also work well with Otterhounds.",

        "grooming": "The thick double coat of the Pekingese requires a good bit of maintenance. Pekingese shed seasonally. Brushing him at least one hour per week will help to remove loose hairs and prevent matting, and an occasional bath will help to keep him looking his best. Mats or tangles can be gently worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort.",

Ever alert, they make good little watchdogs. Pekes might tolerate children but are not appropriate for children to roughhouse with.",
        "health": "As with all short-faced breeds, the natural ease of breathing can be a major concern. It is important to choose a Pekingese with wide-open nostrils on a moderate-sized nose. Because Pekingese don\u2019t have a long muzzle to act as a natural barrier of protection for the eyes, it is important to ensure that your environment is safe for your Peke and that nothing can jab or irritate his eyes. Pekingese appreciate cold temperatures, and therefore some owners travel with their Pekes on frozen ice packs, or an ice pillow, even for rides in the car, which provides a level of comfort that Pekingese thoroughly enjoy. Working with a responsible breeder, those wishing to own a Peke can gain the education they need to know about specific health concerns within the breed. Good breeders utilize health testing of their breeding stock to reduce the likelihood of disease in their puppies.",

Small breeds like Pomeranians can be mistaken for rabbits or squirrels to large, predatorial birds such as hawks and owls, so it is vital to keep a Pom under cover or stay with them at all times.

Agility, combined with soundness of mind and body, is of prime importance for the proper fulfillment of this centuries-old task.\n",
        "nutrition": "It is recommended that Puli owners consult the responsible breeder of their dog and/or a respected veterinarian for suggestions of the best food for their dog. As with other breeds, among those experienced in the breed are some proponents of particular brands of kibble, cooking for your dog, or feeding a raw diet.",
        "grooming": "The Puli can be kept corded, brushed, or with a clipped coat. Until a Puli puppy is 8 to 10 months old, there is no grooming to do except for regular bathing  and ears, and grinding toe nails. When the Puli\u2019s undercoat begins to come in, the coat will begin to feel thick and matted to your fingers. You will begin to feel natural separations in the coat, where the hair seems to clump together close to the skin. This is the beginning of a cord. At this time, you can separate these soft clumps from each other by pulling them apart with your fingers. Cords are simply \u201corganized mats\u201d that have tightened up with time. This is a process that will be repeated many times over the course of about six to nine months. Once the coat has distinct cords, all you do is bathe the dog when needed and separate the cords\u2014a good time to do this is while you are watching TV and need something to do with your hands. The breed\u2019s national parent club, the  Puli Club of America, provides a number of articles on grooming on the club\u2019s website.",
        "exercise": "The Puli is a high-drive dog who requires both physical and mental stimulation. In fact, mental exercise is as important as physical exercise for this breed. Reputable breeders caution people to not overdo the physical exercise when the dog is young and the growth-plates have not yet fused or closed. The Puli excels at canine sports including herding, obedience, and agility, among other activities.",
        "training": "This is a breed that needs to be kept mentally active. Pulik are incredibly intelligent, agile, and loyal, which makes them able to learn quickly, and they strive to please their owners. However, they do not suffer fools lightly (there is a running joke that you need to be very smart to own a Puli), and they require a firm but fair hand. This is a headstrong breed who has no problem humiliating you in public\u2014so prepare yourself. Pulik are herding dogs, and as such, many of them do not give up control easily. They will follow commands, but they do things their own way. They do not care for repetition. With puppies especially, it is important to do proper socialization.",

The overall dog must present a balanced image with no one part exaggerated over another. The Russell Terrier is full of life, and moves with confidence that matches his keen expression. Coat may be smooth, broken or rough and may have tan and/or black markings with no preference for coat type or markings. Tail docking is optional.\n",
        "nutrition": "The Russell Terrier should be fed high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with overly high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet.",
        "grooming": "The Russell Terrier\u2019s rough and ready appearance is easily maintained. Coats come in three types: smooth, broken, and rough. The dense, short smooth coat can be kept looking great with an all-over rubdown with a soft brush or a hound glove once a week. The rough and broken coats will require going over with a brush or a dog comb weekly but are kept mostly natural, with minimal grooming. The Parson\u2019s nails should be trimmed monthly, and his ears checked weekly for debris or excess wax and cleaned as needed.",
        "exercise": "The Russell Terrier is not a breed for a couch-potato family. High energy levels and a robust personality make this an excellent choice of breed for an outdoorsy family who takes lots of hikes, bike rides, and long daily walks. Finding games he loves to play will help keep his brain and his body exercised. A tired Russell Terrier is a good RT. With an almost limitless supply of energy, this makes a great companion dog for children who understand dogs. The breed has retained a strong prey drive so should be very well socialized early on to circumvent any problems that might result from that trait.",
        "training": "The first tool one must have when training a Russell Terrier is a good sense of humor. They are extremely intelligent and love to work on problems and play games. They bore easily, so training sessions must be kept entertaining if you want them to learn. They master tricks easily and love entertaining people by performing. They throw themselves into any job or activity with the same dedication they were bred to have for hunting purposes. They are great choices for canine sports such as agility, flyball, obedience, rally, and even lure coursing.",
        "health": "The majority of Russell Terriers are happy, healthy little dogs, and only a few health issues are known in the breed. They include patellar luxation (loose kneecaps), deafness, and eye disease.

They thrive on human companionship and will let you know if they are feeling neglected. Their coat is either semi-long or smooth. The longhaired variety carries a nice ruff on the chest and unique feathering on the extremities, tail and ears. Long-coated Russian Toys will not have an adult coat until it is more than a year old and full fringing not until three years of age. The smooth-coated variety is sleek and smooth to the touch.\u00a0There is also a slight attitude difference between the two varieties. Smooth Coats tend to be a little more terrier-like than Long Coats.

Although they are quick to alert, they will not be a constant barker with early training on appropriate behavior. They are fairly independent for a toy breed and require early socialization with people. However, Bolonki do get along well with dogs and other animals.

        "nutrition": "Top-quality protein is needed for toy breeds like the Bolonka, as they only eat small amounts. However, be aware that too much protein can cause Pancreatitis. Small amounts of meat, eggs, yogurt and cottage cheese are enjoyed. Safe things to chew on will help keep their teeth clean.",
        "grooming": "The Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka requires regular brushing and routine care for eyes, ears, teeth and nails. Brush or comb the coat with a wide-tooth comb on a regular basis several times per week to prevent mats from forming. Dogs kept in full coat may need their face, mustaches, and beard washed daily. For show purposes, no other trimming other than the feet is permitted, and the coat on the back should fall naturally and should not be deliberately parted.\u00a0The eyes and ears should be checked frequently for foreign matter, injury, and irritation. Keeping the eyes clean will help avoid infections. Hair in the eyes can cause irritation leading up to painful corneal scratches and ulcers. Drop ears are prone to infection, particularly after bathing or swimming, so be sure to keep ears clean and dry.",
        "exercise": "As classic lapdogs, Bolonki enjoy walks and playtime, but do not require a great deal exercise. They can be very energetic and play driven, however, and should have a good romp at least twice per week.

            "During the following centuries, these Saint predecessors were widely used in the valley farms and Alpine dairies for a variety of guarding, herding, and drafting duties. They were referred to as Talhunds (Valley dogs) or Bauernhunds (Farm dogs).",
            "The first notation concerning Saints was not until 1707, although it was written casually so as to imply that the breeds' work at the Saint Bernard Pass in between Switzerland and Italy was well known.",
            "The dogs served as guard dogs of the hospice located in the pass (founded by Archdeacon Bernard de Menthon), and the lonely monks, who took the dogs along on their trips of mercy, soon discovered the excellent path finding and scent abilities of the dogs. The dogs' highly developed sense of smell enabled the breed to locate the freezing and helpless during snowstorms. The monks and saints were immortalized in many of the world's most romantic pages of canine history, it is estimated.",
            "It is estimated that during the three centuries of rescue work, the Saints have saved over 2000 lives.",
            "Prior to 1830, all Saint Bernards were shorthaired; it took 2 years of uncommonly severe weather and a dwindling of the Saint breed to convince the monks to outcross the breed with longer-haired dogs, resulting in a long-haired variety.",

Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog\u2019s calorie consumption and weight level. The breed is susceptible to bloat, a life-threatening condition where the stomach distends and twists. The causes of bloat aren\u2019t fully understood, but experts agree that multiple, small meals per day and preventing vigorous exercise around mealtimes may help reduce the chances of it happening.",
        "grooming": "Saint Bernards come in long-haired and short-haired varieties, but both types of coats require the same care. Weekly brushing will help to remove dirt and loose hair and keep the dog looking his best. Any tangles can be worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb. During shedding season shedding season, which occurs twice a year, brushing will become a daily activity. The occasional bath will keep the Saint looking and smelling fresh. As with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can be painful to the dog and cause problems walking and running.",
        "exercise": "Despite being a large and powerful breed, the St. Bernard only requires a moderate amount of exercise. One long walk or half-hour play session per day should be enough to keep him healthy and happy. Of course, if his owner wants to take longer hikes, or go backpacking or on a camping trip, a Saint is always happy to go along. Saints often enjoy pulling young children in a cart, and some even participate in carting and drafting competitions. A Saint is happiest when he is doing activities together with his owner.",
        "training": "Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for all dogs, but are absolutely required for dogs as big and strong as a St. Bernard.

Saints are kind-hearted and eager to please, so they generally start responding to commands as soon they understand what is expected of them.

A kibble based on lamb and rice (rather than corn or wheat) can help avoid potential food allergies. A dollop of cottage cheese (for calcium) and yogurt (for digestive-tract health) on their food are healthy supplement options that the hound will enjoy. Saluki appetites can range from the skimpy to the gluttonous.

Many Saluki owners will use a snood to keep their ear feathering out of the food bowl (smooth Salukis do not have that problem). They are very clean dogs and known for not having a \u201cdoggy\u201d odor. Bathing need only be done if they get dirty or before a dog show.",
        "exercise": "Salukis need regular exercise to keep fit, and daily walks (always on a leash) will help both hound and owner stay in shape, both physically and mentally. They love to run and should have a well-fenced yard to keep them safely away from traffic. Public dog parks may be a good option as long as they are all getting along. Like other dogs, Salukis can be escape artists or destructive chewers when bored or unhappy at home, so good fencing and safe toys and chew-bones are a must.",

(2) Basic obedience training will help the dog learn manners in the home and community. Well-behaved dogs are welcome almost everywhere. (3) For mental stimulation and exercise, canine sports such as lure coursing, flyball, and agility are all fun options.

If you are not doing it yourself, it may be hard to find a groomer who will do this for a pet. In that case it is acceptable to clipper the coat. With clipping you will eventually lose the correct harsh texture, as the undercoat will take over once the cutting process is begun. Clipped coats can be maintained on a six- to eight-week schedule. A weekly brushing and comb-out will keep the Scottie\u2019s coat tangle free and the skin healthy. Periodic baths with the grooming is acceptable with a good-quality moisturizing shampoo.",

The long coat is harsh and straight, with a dense undercoat, and comes in black, blue merle, and sable, with white markings. The coat, along with a long, wedge-shaped head; small, three-quarter erect ears; and deep-chested, level-backed torso, give Shelties the look of a rough-coated Collie in miniature.\nBright and eager Shelties are easy trainers and world-class competitors in obedience, agility, and herding trials. They are sensitive and affectionate family dogs, highly in tune with the mood of the household. They like to bark and tend to be reserved toward strangers\u2014two qualifications of an excellent watchdog.\n",
        "Facts": [

        "Blurb": "\n            The Shetland Sheepdog, also known as the Sheltie, is an extremely intelligent, quick, and obedient herder from Scotland\u2019s remote and rugged Shetland Islands. Shelties bear a strong family resemblance to their bigger cousin, the Collie.\n        ",
        "General_apperance": "The Shetland Sheepdog is a small, alert, rough-coated, longhaired working dog. He must be sound, agile and sturdy. The outline should be so symmetrical that no part appears out of proportion to the whole. Dogs should appear masculine; bitches feminine.\n",
        "nutrition": "A high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the Sheltie needs. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with very high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet.",
        "grooming": "The Sheltie has a profuse double coat that sheds considerably. The outer coat consists of long, straight, harsh hair, while the undercoat is short, furry, and very dense. Owners must be prepared to brush the coat weekly, and more often during shedding season, to help in removing at least some of the loose hair before it drifts all over the house. Be sure to check for mats behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the \u201cpants\u201d under the tail. Shaving the dog is not recommended, because the coat protects against sunburn and heat as well as cold. The Sheltie needs a bath only occasionally. The nails should trimmed regularly.",
        "exercise": "Shelties are active and athletic, and they need a moderate amount of exercise but are also very adaptable to their family\u2019s way of life. They do well as city dogs as long as owners provide sufficient exercise. They enjoy outings with their people that will occupy both their mind and body. Shelties enjoy and excel in many canine events, including obedience, agility, herding, and tracking, and they shine as therapy dogs.",
        "training": "As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Very intelligent, trainable, and willing to please, the Sheltie will reach his best potential as a companion when taught at least basic obedience\u2014and they are superstars at canine sports such as agility. Shelties can be quite vocal and express their happiness with barking, so owners must be prepared to teach the dog to stop barking when desired. As is common with other herding breeds, Shelties like to chase moving things, including cars, so they should have a well-fenced yard and be walked on a leash.",
        "health": "Shetland Sheepdogs are generally healthy dogs, although there are a few health conditions to which the breed may be predisposed. Some known health concerns for Shelties include hip dysplasia, thyroid disease, eye diseases, dermatomyositis (Sheltie skin syndrome), von Willebrand\u2019s disease (vWD), gallbladder mucoceles, and epilepsy.

Males and females are distinctly different in appearance: males are masculine without coarseness, females are feminine without weakness of structure.\n",
        "nutrition": "Shibas have no specific dietary requirements and generally do well on any good-quality kibble or the raw diet. Some Shibas are picky, and others will eat anything in sight. As with all breeds, the Shiba owner must guard against the dog becoming obese, especially if spayed or neutered. You should be able to feel the dog\u2019s ribs and backbone, but not see them.",
        "grooming": "Shibas shed \u2014 a lot. It has been said that they shed twice a year, but some owners quip that it lasts for six months at a time. Unless a Shiba is a \u201clong coat,\u201d the coat does not mat, so infrequent brushing doesn\u2019t hurt the dog, but brushing or combing during periods of heavy shedding will reduce the amount of hair around the house. Blowing the dog with a strong blow-dryer or a shop vacuum in reverse is a good way to remove loose hair, dirt, and dandruff and to check for fleas. Most dogs learn to like the blower, as it feels good and doesn\u2019t scrape the skin or pull the coat. Don\u2019t let it get too hot, though. Shibas often object to nail trimming nail trimming. Start a puppy early, but if it becomes a major struggle, let a professional do it.",
        "exercise": "Most Shibas are fairly energetic and love to go for walks. They are not so hyper that they will climb the walls if they don\u2019t get daily exercise, but a Shiba owner should be dedicated to exercising the dog, especially if the dog doesn\u2019t have an adequate yard in which to exercise himself. In general, Shibas are not massively destructive if left alone once they reach maturity, but some can suffer separation anxiety and should be able to spend periods of time crated even when the owners are home and at night. Crating guarantees a home will remain intact.",
        "training": "The one thing every Shiba owner must know is that a Shiba can never, ever be considered reliable off lead unless in a confined area. No amount of obedience training will ever change that. Letting a Shiba off lead\u2014or any dog, for that matter\u2014is playing Russian roulette with its life. An open door, an unlocked gate, a moment of inattentiveness, and the Shiba may be gone forever. On the positive side, a Shiba is practically born housebroken. By 4 weeks of age the puppy is trying to get as far away from his sleeping area as possible to eliminate. By 5 weeks the puppy will hold it all night and wait until taken outside to go. Controlling the bladder tales a little longer and depends a lot on immediate access to outdoors and diligence of the owner.",
        "health": "The most common health condition in Shibas and in most breeds, as well as humans, is allergies. In dogs, allergies manifest themselves as skin irritation and itching. There is no way of testing breeding stock, but dogs with active allergies should not be bred. Unless the source of the allergen can be identified, most dogs with allergies can lead normal lives with products that treat the symptoms\u2014again, just like humans. Allergies usually don\u2019t manifest themselves until a dog is at least 6 months old. Other conditions that sometimes occur in the breed include hip dysplasia, eye disorders, and patella luxation.

        "Blurb": "\n            A charming member of the AKC Toy Group, the compact, glossy-coated Silky Terrier is nonetheless a true terrier of energetic high spirits. The Silky, a native of Sydney, Australia, is larger than his close cousin, the Yorkshire Terrier.\n        ",
        "General_apperance": "The Silky Terrier is a true \u201ctoy terrier\u201d. He is moderately low set, slightly longer than tall, of refined bone structure, but of sufficient substance to suggest the ability to hunt and kill domestic rodents. His coat is silky in texture, parted from the stop to the tail and presents a well groomed but not sculptured appearance. His inquisitive nature and joy of life make him an ideal companion.\n",
        "nutrition": "The Silky Terrier should be fed a high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior) and ideally formulated for small or toy breeds. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with very high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet.",
        "grooming": "The Silky Terrier\u2019s coat should be brushed at least twice a week with a pin brush or soft bristle brush. A long-toothed metal dog comb can also come in handy for gently working through areas where tangles may be beginning to form. Left unattended, tangles and mats are uncomfortable for your dog and can cause skin problems to develop. The nails should be trimmed once a month, and a bath every four to six weeks with a gentle shampoo meant for dogs will help to keep the coat and skin clean and healthy. Grooming sessions are a good time to check the dog all over for any new lumps or skin problems, and to check that the eyes and ears are healthy and trouble free.",
        "exercise": "More a terrier than a lapdog, the Silky Terrier requires more exercise than most Toy Group breeds. Intelligent, bold, and energetic, Silkies need human partners who will know how to channel that energy into daily exercise and training for sports and work. The breed does well in the conformation ring, and Silkies have been successful in companion events, particularly agility.",

Taken by the breed\u2019s charm, owners may be tempted to let a Silky Terrier get away with undesirable behaviors; it\u2019s best to be sure to make rules and stick to them. The breed has a strong prey drive, and a leash is essential when walking outside.",
        "health": "While Silky Terriers are generally healthy dogs, there are several health and genetic screening considerations specific to the breed. Responsible breeders test their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to, including patellar luxation and eye disease. A Silky Terrier\u2019s ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.

Ears should be checked at least weekly and cleaned of any excess wax or debris to avoid ear infections that dogs with drop ears can be prone to.

Like all terriers, they can be stubborn, but they enjoy interaction with their human and are eager to please.

For those who understand the breed\u2019s temperament and raise the dog with love and proper training and socialization, there is no more delightful companion.",

The distinguishing physical trait, besides coat type, is the head: A Smooth\u2019s head is more V-shaped than a Wire\u2019s. The dense, flat coat is predominantly white, with black, tan, or black-and-tan markings. These cleverly made hunters are strong and sturdy, but never coarse and clunky.

If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no \u201csurprises\u201d in store before calming down again.\nThis breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands.

They\u2019re strong willed (as they need to be to do their job), and your goal should be to get the dog to work happily with you. Most do extremely well with clicker training, and most are very biddable.",
        "health": "There is some incidence in the breed of hip dysplasia (as with most breeds), and the breed can be affected by an eye issue called Swedish Vallhund retinopathy. A genetic test for this was developed in 2017. In most dogs who have the first stage of the disease, it does not progress and does not affect vision. If it does progress to the second stage, affected dogs may have some reduction in night vision, but day vision is unaffected. In the rare cases which progress to the third stage, vision may be significantly affected, and a few dogs have gone blind, but almost all are older dogs with additional issues such as cataracts, which also affect vision. Testing, and being aware of how this issue appears in bloodlines, while taking a sensible and balanced approach to which dogs to breed together, makes the most sense at this time, in order to avoid losing genetic diversity over an issue with minimal effect on most dogs who have it.",

Coat colors include solid blue, black, red or fawn with a black mask occasionally on the red-coated dogs.\u00a0Thai Ridgebacks also have spotted tongues and some even come with solid black/blue tongues. Today, most Ridgebacks are companion dogs, but they still maintain many of the same instincts for the jobs for which they were bred: hunting and guarding. They had to be independent, self-sufficient and hunt for their own food, which gave them strong survival instincts, a high prey drive, and a high level of intelligence.\nIf well bred and properly socialized, the Thai Ridgeback\u00a0can be a loyal, loving pet. As a guarding breed, they are naturally protective of their home and can be reserved and suspicious with strangers.

A breed hallmark is the beautiful and profuse double coat\u2014wooly underneath, with a long, fine topcoat. TTs are unique among dogs for their large, flat \u201csnowshoe\u201d feet, adapted over centuries to help them negotiate the snowy, mountainous terrain of their homeland.\n",
        "Facts": [
            "The Tibetan Terrier originated in Tibet.",

            "The first \"official\" Tibetan Terrier was brought to the US in 1956.",
            "The Tibetan Terrier is not actually a \"Terrier,\" but was dubbed that because of his Terrier size."

        "Blurb": "\n            The Tibetan Terrier, \u201cHoly Dog of Tibet,\u201d is an ancient watchdog and companion long associated with Buddhist monasteries. A profusely coated, small-to-medium-sized dog with \u201csnowshoe\u201d feet, the TT is affectionate, sensitive, and clever.\n        ",
        "General_apperance": "The Tibetan Terrier is a medium-sized dog, profusely coated, of powerful build, and square in proportion. A fall of hair covers the eyes and foreface. The well-feathered tail curls up and falls forward over the back. The feet are large, flat, and round in shape producing a snowshoe effect that provides traction. The Tibetan Terrier is well balanced and capable of both strong and efficient movement. The Tibetan Terrier is shown as naturally as possible.\n",
        "nutrition": "Tibetan Terriers evolved in a challenging land that experienced both feast and fast as a way of life. A traditional Tibetan diet would include staples such as easily digestible gruel (cooked barley flour), and meat broth. TTs often received the leftover gruel as food. A naturally lean animal that savors their food (they chew it!), it is not unusual for TTs to leave some in their bowls. Historically, the diet of peasants promoted longevity, while the rich foods of kings created disease. With this in mind, it is best to feed an honest food with real ingredients, and trust a TT to eat what they need rather than rely on the instructions on a feed bag. A lean dog is more energetic, healthier, and full of happy life force!",
        "grooming": "Prospective TT owners may mistakenly think this is not the dog for them based upon the manicured, flowing coats seen on televised dog shows. But there\u2019s an agile, versatile dog underneath with a multi-purpose coat suited for everyday life. TTs have a double coat, the undercoat being wool, resistant to moisture and a natural insulator. Coat textures can vary from softer to harder to more or less prone to matting. The natural coat of the breed can stand up to most anything nature can dish out. It may be convenient to keep the dog in a puppy cut if a full coat hinders desired outdoor adventures. That being said, the real benefit of a grooming practice with a TT is that it strengthens the bond in relationship, is great training, and is a way to monitor the dog\u2019s health. It may come as a surprise how enjoyable grooming can be.",
        "exercise": "TTs love to take walks and be outdoors with their people. Individuals within the breed may have more or less drive for exercise. A good breeder will be able to place the compatible dog with a prospective owner. If you want to hike up a mountain, there\u2019s a TT for that. If you\u2019re more of a homebody and simply walk around the block or take the stairs a couple times a day, there\u2019s a TT for that. Many TTs enjoy a post in the house where they can look out a window or door and perform sentry duty for their household. If this spot is an overlook like a stair landing or balcony, all the better.",
        "training": "This is an independent-minded breed who is quick to learn and will wither under obsessive repetition or harsh methods. Training practices that allow the dog to choose the right behavior are recommended. Clicker training instruction is widely available, and both human and dog will enjoy the developing partnership from training together. TTs are enthusiastic students who love working closely with their owner (in things such as agility, rally, and nose work) and performing jobs that contribute to the household. They seek companionship based on mutual cooperation, trust, and respect. They have great capacity for love and devotion to their people.",
        "health": "TTs can be a hardy, healthy breed that ages gracefully. But just as second-generation immigrants to Western countries succumb to Western diseases, the same phenomenon might be linked to the shift in TT health issues due to environmental changes in diet and lifestyle from its country of origin. Early spay and neuters can predispose dogs to joint issues. Many breeders request that the dog reach maturity before altering. Geriatric heart murmurs and cataracts are not uncommon in aging TTs. Occasionally senior TTs are struck with vestibular disease, which is fortunately something from which they can recover. Cancer is an increasing concern in aging TTs. Allergies, thyroid issues, bladder stones, periodontal disease, hip and patella issues can also occur. Genetic tests (such as for NCL, LL, PRA, etc.) are a valuable tool used by breeders.",

        "General_apperance": "Characteristics \u2013 Called \u2018the people\u2019s choice\u2019 among all coonhound breeds, the energetic Treeing Walker is perfectly suited for the task for which it was bred \u2013 tracking and treeing wild raccoons in their natural haunts. The breed\u2019s competitive spirit makes it an ideal choice for competitive coonhound events where the breed excels. The Treeing Walker Coonhound is alert, intelligent, active, courteous, and courageous with extreme endurance and the desire to perform.\n",
        "nutrition": "The Treeing Walker Coonhound should be fed a high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog\u2019s age and activity level. A hound who isn\u2019t working can be prone to becoming overweight, so owners should monitor the dog\u2019s calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with overly high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet.",
        "grooming": "The Treeing Walker is a very low-maintenance breed. His short, smooth coat repels dirt and mud, and he will require only the occasional bath to maintain his handsome appearance. Wiping him down with a damp towel or a hound glove will keep him shining. His nails should be trimmed every couple of weeks, as long nails can cause the dog discomfort and structural problems. A hound\u2019s ears should be cleaned regularly to keep them free of excess wax or debris and to check for any signs of ear infection. The Treeing Walker will look forward to grooming sessions as bonding experiences with the human whom he loves.",
        "exercise": "Like most coonhounds, the Treeing Walker is a high-energy breed who delights in stretching his legs in a good, long run. He is an excellent candidate for someone who wants a running or hiking companion. While most coonhounds can quite happily become couch potatoes, most will still appreciate long daily walks at a minimum. Romps in the backyard, chasing a ball, or playing with human or canine friends will help to keep him mentally and physically healthy. The Treeing Walker has a very high prey drive and should be on a leash for walks and hikes, as he may be unable to resist the instinct to pursue an interesting scent.",
        "training": "The Treeing Walker Coonhound is very intelligent and eager to learn. These hounds love to please their people, but they also have a stubborn, independent streak. This can make them seem difficult to a trainer who doesn\u2019t understand the coonhound brain. Keeping training lessons fun and entertaining and praising good behavior and jobs well done with treats as well as effusive praise will result in a hound who is a joy to live with.",
        "health": "As with most larger breeds, hip dysplasia sometimes occurs in the breed. Some eye problems are possible as well, but the breed is overall quite healthy. Be sure to always check the dog\u2019s ears when he comes in from outside, as ticks love to burrow beneath the coonhound\u2019s floppy ears. Removing excess ear wax and debris and checking the ears at least weekly will help you to avoid common ear infections.",

        "General_apperance": "That of a medium-sized, short-coated, hunting dog of distinguished appearance and bearing. Robust but rather lightly built, the coat is an attractive shaded golden rust. Originating in Hungary, the Vizsla was bred to work in field, forest and water. Agile and energetic, this is a versatile dog of power, drive and endurancein the field yet a tractable and affectionate companion in the home. It is strongly emphasized that field conditioned coats, as well as brawny or sinewy muscular condition and honorable scars indicating a working and hunting dog are never to be penalized in this dog. The requisite instincts and abilities to maintain a \u201cdual dog\u201d are always to be fostered and appreciated, never deprecated.\n",
        "nutrition": "Most Vizslas are good eaters, and the majority do well on any high-quality brand of dry dog food. Some owners choose to prepare their own cooked or raw diet, following specific nutritional instructions from recognized experts. To add variety, many owners supplement kibble with small amounts of leftovers from their own meals (avoiding onions, raisins, grapes, chocolate, and other foods that are not healthy for dogs). Owners need to watch out for overfeeding and resulting weight gain. There is considerable variation in individual dogs\u2019 caloric needs; a young, active dog may require four or five cups each day of a high-calorie food, while older or less active dogs may need less than half that quantity.",
        "grooming": "Vizslas have a short, sleek coat with no undercoat, so they don\u2019t require complicated grooming. They do shed, and occasional brushing with a rubber grooming brush is helpful. When they get especially dirty (or when they roll in something smelly), they will need a bath with lukewarm water, a good-quality dog soap, and thorough rinsing. It is important to keep the toenails short, either with a clipper or with a grinding tool. Ears should be checked frequently for dirt, wax build-up, or signs of irritation. Regular use of a mild ear-cleaning product will help prevent problems. To keep teeth and gums healthy, regular cleaning is recommended; use a product formulated for dogs (not human toothpaste).",
        "exercise": "Vizslas were bred to be active hunting dogs, and they need both physical and mental exercise. Individual dogs\u2019 needs vary, but, in general, owners should plan on a minimum of 30 minutes of active exercise daily\u2014and some dogs will need more than that. In addition to leash walks and games of fetch, most Vizslas need opportunities to run hard off-leash on a regular basis. Mental exercise is as important as physical activity, so training should be part of their routine. Vizslas can be excellent running or jogging companions, with the caveat that young dogs should not run long distances until they reach maturity at about 18 to 24 months. Older Vizslas typically remain active and playful.",
        "training": "Vizslas need consistent, positive training, starting in puppyhood. They are highly intelligent, curious, and sometimes manipulative, so owners need to establish solid communication and teach good behavior. Untrained Vizslas are hard to live with. They can find many creative ways get into trouble if they don\u2019t have a \u201cjob.\u201d Fortunately, they typically love training and thrive on the attention they receive. This is a sensitive breed, so early and ongoing socialization is important to make sure the dog has the confidence to enjoy various activities. With good socialization and consistent training, there are countless ways to have fun with these versatile dogs, including field trials, hunting tests, conformation, obedience, rally, agility, dock diving, barn hunts, lure coursing, scent work, and tracking.",

Owners should feed a highly rated food that has a moderately high protein content. If feeding kibble, some people add water to the dry food. If the dry food is enhanced with canned food or table scraps, be careful not to add too much. Rich food can upset their digestion.",
        "grooming": "The biggest job in grooming the Weimaraner is keeping the nails short. This is important for the comfort and health of your dog and cannot be overemphasized. When nail length gets out of hand, it\u2019s difficult to get it back to a proper length. (If you can hear a tap-tap-tap when they cross a hardwood floor, the nails are too long.) The short coat should be brushed to remove \u201cdead hair.\u201d Don\u2019t forget to clean the ears clean the ears, since having an ear structure that impedes air-flow makes for the potential of infected ears.",
        "exercise": "Weimaraners have high exercise requirements. They need consistent exercise for their physical and mental well being. They love a good run. While walking is OK, stretching their legs and getting \u201cup a full head of steam\u201d is far better. A tired Weimaraner is a good Weimaraner.",

Early socialization and puppy training are vital and help to ensure that the Weimaraner grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion.",
        "health": "Being a very active breed, Weimaraners get more than their share of accidental cuts, scrapes, sprains, and pulls. They love to chew, and that makes for mouth and gum injury. Be careful of them ingesting things that should not go down a dog\u2019 s throat. The most serious health issue in the breed is gastric torsion.

        "General_apperance": "The West Highland White Terrier is a small, game, well-balanced hardy looking terrier, exhibiting good showmanship, possessed with no small amount of self-esteem, strongly built, deep in chest and back ribs, with a straight back and powerful hindquarters on muscular legs, and exhibiting in marked degree a great combination of strength and activity. The coat is about two inches long, white in color, hard, with plenty of soft undercoat. The dog should be neatly presented, the longer coat on the back and sides, trimmed to blend into the shorter neck and shoulder coat. Considerable hair is left around the head to act as a frame for the face to yield a typical Westie expression.\n",
        "nutrition": "The West Highland White Terrier should be fed a high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior) and activity level. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet or the dog\u2019s breeder if you have any questions or concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should always be available.",
        "grooming": "To keep the Westie looking his best, regular grooming is a must. Stripping (or plucking) the old, dead hair is the traditional way of taking care of the terrier coat, and it is the grooming method that must be used if you\u2019re interested in showing your dog. Pet owners often have their dogs\u2019 coats clipped for neatness. Most people find a professional groomer who will help keep that beautiful Westie look. Usually a visit to the groomer every 4 to 6 weeks will work just fine. Daily brushing and combing is important. Because the Westie has a hard coat, bathing too often can be more harmful than helpful.",
        "exercise": "Westies love to romp and play, and they enjoy a nice walk. SInce by nature they will run after anything that moves, the breed does best in a fenced area or on a leash. With their intelligence, energy, and can-do attitude, Westies excel in a variety of canine sports and activities, including obedience, rally, and agility. True to the breed\u2019s original purpose, they have the instinct to go to ground and are superstars at earthdog events.",
        "training": "Smart, confident, adaptable, and endlessly entertaining at play, the adorable Westie has charmed owners for more than 300 years. Like all terriers, Westies were bred to work alone. This terrier independence can make training a challenge, but thanks to their keen intelligence Westies take to patient, consistent lessons that are kept upbeat and interesting. Despite their size, Westies are sturdy, no-nonsense dogs who require little pampering.",
        "health": "While West Highland White Terriers are generally healthy dogs, there are several health and genetic screening considerations specific to the breed. Disorders that can affect Westies include cardiac disease and patellar luxation. Responsible breeders test their stock for conditions the breed can be prone to. A Westie\u2019s teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.",

        "training": "Whippets are calm in the house, preserving their energy for explosive bursts of running\u2014ideally in a large, securely fenced area. Young Whippets are smart, agile, and mischievous, and they can jump and climb, so confining them safely while not under supervision is a must. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended and help to ensure that the dog grows into a well-adjusted, well-mannered companion.",
        "health": "The Whippet frame is not well suited to carrying excessive weight. While young Whippets may appear gangly and have difficulty keeping their ribs covered when they are in the period of rapid growth, a mature adult should not appear ribby but should have two to four visible vertebrae, and the hipbones should not appear sunk into dimples of fat. A Whippet at a healthy weight will likely appear \u201cskinny\u201d to those accustomed to heavier-bodied, less fleet breeds, but maintaining your Whippet at the correct weight through lifelong portion control will extend his life and avoid many of the orthopedic problems that are both painful and expensive to repair.

If you will be showing him in conformation events, you will need to learn to hand-strip his coat or pay someone else regularly to do it for you. Pets, however, can be clippered into a trim similar to a show trim with much less effort. All Wire Foxes will require regular brushing to avoid matting, no matter how they are groomed. Nails should be trimmed monthly. Ears should be checked weekly, and any excess wax and debris should be removed to avoid ear infections.",

Long walks with his owner, chasing a tennis ball in the backyard, or playtime in a large, securely fenced area are all great ways to exercise your dog and keep him mentally and physically fit. Never allow your Wire Fox Terrier to run off-lead, as he is likely to forget all training if he catches sight of a small animal he perceives as prey.",

Supplementation with individual nutrients (e.g. calcium) is not recommended nor, in general, required if a dog is on such a diet. Pet rolls and tinned foods are generally unsuitable as a sole maintenance diet for dogs, as most are not complete and balanced. They can, however, be fed as one component in an overall balanced diet.",

Beyond regular weekly grooming, the occasional bath will keep your Working Kelpie clean and looking his best. Grooming can be a wonderful bonding experience for you and your pet. Their strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed when needed with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked occasionally to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed as needed.",

Exercise can also come in the form of indoor activities, like hide-and-seek, chasing a ball rolled along the floor, or teaching them new tricks. Certain outdoor activities like hiking and retrieving balls or flying discs can provide a good outlet for expending energy. Training for dog sports like agility, obedience and rally is also a possibility.",
        "training": "Dogs should be trained or taken to reputable training classes from the age of 16 weeks to learn basic commands. Appropriate advice (e.g. from a reputable livestock working dog handler/trainer or veterinarian, or dog behaviorist) should be sought at the early stages of a behavioral problem.

A Xolo is moderate in all aspects of type and conformation, never extreme or overdone. Today the breed serves as a guard and companion. The Xolo possesses a clean, graceful outline, equally combining elegance and strength. There are two varieties, hairless and coated, identical except for coat and dentition. In the hairless variety, the principal characteristic is the total or almost total absence of hair. The coated variety is covered by a short, flat coat. In conformation, all three sizes are lean, sturdy, well muscled with a spacious rib-cage, and moderate bone. The Xolo outline is rectangular, and the distance from the elbow to ground is equal to, or slightly greater than, the distance from the withers to the elbow.

        "About": "\nFor centuries the Yakutian Laika was an irreplaceable and faithful assistant of a man in the conditions where the slightest demonstration of weakness was punished with death. It always received respectful attitude from its human family, which treated it as its member rather than a simple domestic animal. This means that it developed into a fabulous companion dog, devoted, lively and biddable. The breed is extremely gentle and considerate with children to whom it commonly establishes especially tight bonds. Nevertheless its friendly nature doesn\u2019t exclude the necessity of certain amount of socialisation, preferably in the early age.\nThe Yakutian Laika is slightly reserved with unknown people but in the most cases it\u2019s excited to acquire a new playmate. Human aggressiveness was considered by dogs\u2019 breeders as a major fault and was meticulously eliminated from its characteristics. The breed is endowed with very sensitive nose and ears, which make it rather capable watchdog. However its barking is no more than a mean to show its anticipation of the perspective of making a new acquaintance. This dog will most probably fail in the role of a guardian because of its friendly nature.\nThe Yakutian Laika used to pull a narta (sled) in close collaboration with dozens of other dogs so it\u2019s quite accepting of other dogs. The breed surely prefers to have one or several constant canine companions. It can be introduced with few issues to the household with pre-existing dog, although it should be performed with necessary caution. The second primary duty of this breed was hunting and it preserves much of its prey drive. That\u2019s why its communication with other small and average animals should never go unsupervised. The Yakutian Laika will most likely get on with a home cat if they have been reared together.\n",

Generally, he should be brushed weekly to prevent matting and tangles. When shedding heavily, it is a good idea to brush him every day to keep the hair from getting onto everything. Use a pin brush and metal comb when grooming. A deshedder or detangler may also make your job a little easier. Since the Yakutian Laika is a working dog, excessive trimming of his coat is not necessary. Trim between his foot pads to keep snow, ice and other debris from accumulating and causing him irritation. His coat naturally repels dirt and he does not have an odor, so bathing should only be done two to three times a year. Trim his nails when needed, usually every two to three weeks. Clean his ears each week as part of his grooming routine.",
