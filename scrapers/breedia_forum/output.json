Sweet little dogs and naturally she adores them.",

    "Argh! Can't believe I missed this! Why didn't someone PM me?????\n\nFirst SLB, of course you have a perfect right not to like any breed of dog but what's not to like about Affens?     \n\nSo if I am to make any headway in converting you I need to know what it is about them you object to? As you say you are attracted to some of the less obviously attractive breeds but is it their looks? Or size? Or temperament? \n\nSo I shall start with what I like about them...\n\nthey are small, but 'cobby', \nfriendly but not obsequious, \nbusy but not manic, \nfeisty but not too 'terrierish', \nunusual but not inbred\n\n...and for me the looks tick all the boxes, black, scruffy, cutest face in the world but with a breed standard that states they must not have breathing difficulties. And finally I found a breeder who lives relatively nearby, breeds for health and temperament primarily and is a lovely person!\n\nNot saying my boys are perfect, Gozo is not stocky enough, he is the offspring of a dog imported from the US to widen the gene pool so threw out a couple of surprises.  And Enzo has a bit of a Napoleon complex that we are working on!  \n\nHave I made any progress? Anything else I need to work on to convince you? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI forgot to mention trainable, Enzo is doing really well at agility and we hope to enter some competitions next year, he's not the fastest dog but only goes wrong if I handle wrong - an unfortunately frequent occurrence!    \n\nETA I don't understand why they are not more common?\n\nJ.",

He is comical, very intelligent and after having him I would never be without an Affen.  You will notice in a lot of temperament descriptions they are described as having 'a higher than average tendency to snap', which can sometimes be true, but I think this is due to their high intelligence and also they 'do not suffer fools'.\n\r\nI would not hesitate to recommend them as a companion - Affens are brilliant.\n\r\nLike I said, I'm not looking for an argument - just wanted to put Herman's case!!!:wink:",

You will notice in a lot of temperament descriptions they are described as having 'a higher than average tendency to snap', which can sometimes be true, but I think this is due to their high intelligence and also they 'do not suffer fools'.\n\r\nI would not hesitate to recommend them as a companion - Affens are brilliant.\n\r\nLike I said, I'm not looking for an argument - just wanted to put Herman's case!!!:wink:Click to expand...\n\nHi Lesley, welcome to dogsey! Good to see you on here defending the lovely Herman, let's face it we all know Mahooli is biased!!:wink: \n\r\nYou'll be pleased to learn that she hasn't managed to put me off and if all goes to plan I'll be picking up my Affen on Sunday!!!! I'm so excited!  :mini:  \n\r\nJ", 
    "I converted Lesley to Poodledom so don't think you've got off lightly lol! There's still time!\r\nBecky", 
    "Mahooli said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI converted Lesley to Poodledom so don't think you've got off lightly lol! There's still time!\r\nBeckyClick to expand...\n\nDefinitely! A mini black and tan or parti is definitely still on my doggy wish list!\n\r\nJ", 
    "I'll get you all in the end   \r\nBecky", 
    "Well, luckily I don't have to choose as I'm on both your sides as I have an Affen and a poodle ;-)  \n\r\nI love them both equally in different ways.  Herman the Affen is such a huge character that you can't help but love him even though he is naughty sometimes!!  Paddi the poodle I can only describe as just gorgeous.  He doesn't have a bad bone in his body - is sweet with everyone (if a bit bossy with dogs visiting the parlour sometimes) and thinks every human and animal on this earth has been put there to be his friend.  He even plays with Dennis, our ferret, for a couple of hours every night - something which I couldn't trust either of my other dogs to do.\n\r\nSo, basically I couldn't choose a favourite between them, but think both breeds will always be a member of my family from now on (even though years ago I swore I would never have a 'poncy poodle' - thought I was a bull terrier person through and through - just shows you how wrong you can be!\n\r\nGood luck with your Affen, you lucky thing - I would love another one - I know you will love it.  Which breeder are you getting it from and is it a dog or a bitch?\n\r\nLesley", 
    "Just wanted to update this thread to say that I now have my Affenpinscher (in case you missed my excited announcement on the general forum!)\n\r\nHe is a male, Orlock Gomez, pet name Gozo. The breeder's website (am I allowed to post this?) is www.orlock.co.uk\n\r\nI have posted pics on the pic forum but here's one of my favs...\n\n\n\r\nLesley if you see Mahooli, I know she can't get on line so much theses days, tell her we are missing her!\n\r\nJ", 
    "He is absolutely gorgeous - thanks for posting the pic.  He's just like a baby monkey and I'm really jealous!!!!\r\nEnjoy his puppyhood.  \r\nLesley.",

    "Mothership how is your little Affenpinscher getting on can you give us an update I have taken quite a shine to these and I would love one but OH won't let me so can I see yours please..\r\nAre there any photo's also of the Parti Poodles would love to see those too\r\nSue",

He's 4 months old now and quite the little charmer! Why won't your OH let you get an Affen? It would make a great companion for Lexi and they really don't take up much space and 2 dogs really isn't much more work than one...\n\r\nBut to keep you going here are a couple of pics of my baby boy.\n\r\n[attach-center]4102[/attach-center]\r\nSide view I took to send to his breeder. He's still very much a puppy, a bit leggy and his coat hasn't come in properly yet, but there is no rush.\n\r\n[attach-center]4101[/attach-center]\r\nPepper and Gozo at the beach, people kept asking if she was his Mum.  \n\r\n[attach-center]4100[/attach-center]\r\nA bit overexposed, it's sooo hard to get good pictures of black dogs.\n\r\nHave you had a look at his breeders website? There are some lovely Affen pics on it?  www.orlock.co.uk\n\r\nJ", 
    "Oh thanks so much for the update on Gozo and yes I have had a look at the Orlock website I just think they are such little charactures with such expressive faces my husband just adores Lexi and thinks the bond would be broken if we had another dog ...\r\nThey are lovely photo's by the way and thanks again for letting me see them...\r\nSue",

That's just silly  that's like saying if you have more than one child you can't love them as much! I have to say that my bond with Pepper is still firmly in place and now I am growing a new one with Gozo - who is definitely a Mummy's boy.  Anyway there are 2 of you so you need a dog each, that's what I told my OH when he was getting the sofa cuddles...\n\r\nKeep working on the OH, you'll wear him down with time.  \n\r\nJ",

    "I have owned Affenpinschers since 1987, and bred the first Affie to gain a stud book number in the UK, I owned the 3rd Affie Bitch to be awarded a CC, Affies are an intellengent breed, only show them what to do a couple of times and they know what to do, Chewbacca is the Top Dog at our Training Club and has to demonstrate things to other  people, they get on well with other dogs,cats, even friends horses, they have even been into schools & Hospices, so temperament has to be good, my Affies have done well in Showing, Agility, Obedience & HTM I would recommend this breed to anyone.",

She's also a lovely person!\n\r\nI had hoped to show Gozo but to be honest I'm not sure if he'll be up to standard. He is the offspring of an American sire Mhairi imported who is making quite small pups so he is a little dinky and slow to mature. We are going up to visit Mhairi and see what she thinks, he's nearly 9 months and I'm not in any hurry, que sera sera.  In the meantime he has turned out to be a fantastic little character and I am loving him to bits! \n\r\nI did take him to puppy agility, just for fun, and he was ok but not particularly interested, but he's having a break now because of the weather.\n\r\nThis a fantastic little breed, I really don't know why they are not more popular?\n\r\nJ", 
    "If everything goes to plan I will be adding an Affenpinscher to our family in the next few weeks.\n\r\nIn the interests of maximizing his socialization and getting him used to all sorts of environments his breeder has suggested I get one of those pet carriers so I can get him out and about as often as possible.\n\r\nI want something practical and nothing pink or twee (and it seems that there is a lot of that out there)  he is a boy after all  \n\r\nAny suggestions/recommendations?\n\r\nThanks\n\r\nJ",
