    "Sorry Rick, although everyone is welcome, this is a UK based forum so we don't know American breeders. The advice I usually give is to contact the AKC or your National Airedale breed club for reputable contacts. www.Airedale.org is a good place to start, as it is the site of the Airedale Terrier Club of America. The AKC site is www.akc.org/dog-breeds/airedale-terrier.\nDon't let anyone use clippers on a wire body coat or it will turn fluffy. Hand stripping does take time, and can be expensive, but it should only need to be done when the coat is 'on the blow' - regular thorough raking and a little tidying up should be all that is needed in between strips. If you follow the links I have given, you should find yourself directed to a good breeder, who will probably ask you lots of questions, but will also give you lots of information and advice about the breed. Good Luck in your search.", 
    "Is there anyone here with experience of airedales? I'm looking at possibly getting a terrier pup in the future and would be interested to know what this breed is like to live with (good and bad).\n\r\nmany thanks", 
    "Hi,\n\r\nWell I have an 8 month old male Airedale (see my post in this section), so can help you out a little.  Oscar is the first Airedale we have owned, but I always wanted one & had done lots of reading up before we were ready to look for one.  We chose a very reputable breeder & visited & met them & their dogs to see what their temperament was like as this can vary from dog to dog.  Theirs are bred from dogs with good temperaments, and we were very happy with what we saw.  We have stayed in contact with the breeders as well as the owners of one of his litter mates.\n\r\nThey can be a dominant breed, so they need gentle but firm training from the outset.  They grow to be quite a large dog (20kg +), so you do need to lay the ground rules whilst they are young.  They do not respond well to harsh punishments or corrections.  We use clicker training & lots of praise & rewards for good behaviour!  We go to puppy class every week, and are hoping to start agility when he is a year old.\n\r\nOscar was very easy to house & crate train - in fact we are having much more of a job persuading him that he doesn't need to use his crate anymore than we did getting him to use it in the first place, & he still \"goes to bed\" in his crate at night!\n\r\nHis teething period seemed very short & he has never chewed on furniture, wires, etc.  He has bones & kongs to gnaw on as he does enjoy chewing.\n\r\nHe does have a bit of a sensitive tum, but this seems to be imporving with age. We feed him only on James Wellbeloved food & treats, and he is a picture of health.\n\r\nThey can be quite a mouthy breed, so it is important to teach them that they must not nip hands, clothing etc when they are puppies.  We found that squealing made him do it more as he seemed to think it was a game, so we used to stop play & walk away until he'd calmed down.  He soon realised that nipping meant playtime was over!\n\r\nPeople told us that Airedales can bark a lot, but Oscar rarely does, mostly if a toy or his kong is stuck under the sofa, or if he needs to go out to toilet.  I think making sure they are well socialised & get used to household noises, different people, different situations, aren't left tied up outside, etc that barking won't be an issue.\n\r\nHe loves exercise, and we have now built up his walks to about 30 mins in the morning & an hour in the evening.  Build it up gradually to avoid hip problems.  Oscar is really quite good off the lead & with recall for a young puppy.  He can cope with most distractions apart from other dogs!  He LOVES meeting new friends & plays really well with any friendly dog (many people have commented on how nicely he plays).\n\r\nAiredales are GREAT fun to have around.  They do seem to have a great sense of humour, and a cheekiness about them.  He is just as happy romping through the fields as he is having snuggles!\n\r\nIf you need any other advice, or want to chat, then just let me know.\n\r\nSorry to have waffled on for so long!\n\r\nKaty x\n\r\nOscar as a little 'un!  He looks all grown up now at 8 months (see pic in my thread)",

How is he doing?  Could you recommend your breeder?  Thank you for answering many of our questions as we too are thinking seriously of buying an Airdale puppy.  The one thing you haven't mentioned is grooming.  How frequently do they need to be cut and is it terribly expensive? Rick", 
    "Hello, I hope someone can help me  \n\nMy 7 month old Airedale is really needing a full strip but, due to other obligations, I cannot do it at this time.  Is it OK for me clip her for now and do the strip when I am able (in about 6-8 weeks)?  Will I damage her coat by using the clippers?  \n\nI am asking because I have a dim memory of someone saying that it is a problem.\n\nPoor girl is suffering from the heat already (we have a mini heatwave here in Bulgaria at the moment with temps in the mid 70's already!), so I need to make her more comfy soon  \n\nHuge thanks in advance xx", 
    "Hi, there is a good chance that clipping the coat will make it difficult to strip in the future, as clipping can damage wire coats.  You need to decide on one method or the other.  If you want to strip it, could you not just give her a going over with a coat king for now?",

    "i am currently dog sitting for 4airedales, id previously only ever met one or two before, and never lived with any! they are lovely dogs, it took me a little while to 'get' their unique body language due to the beard and everything. \r\nsomething i was wondering though, theyre small, or at least compared to how big i remember them being, i remember large, lean long-legged dogs, and these are alot smaller. is this a general breed change? or just these 4? even the male isnt as big as the females i remember! will post piccies of them soon to bulk up the airedale section!", 
    "Can't wait for more Airedale pictures! Not sure whether there's been a change in size, but I think a lot of irish are getting bigger than the breed standard, so at this rate they'll end up the same size!", 
    "Please more pics of this beautiful breed.  I love them", 
    "Hello Yvonne,\n\r\nThe Airedale is 1 of my favourite terriers, people don't realise how big they are there the largest terrier if i remember rightly, what are there protective instincts like? i know there not bred to guard but would imagine there a very loyal dog.",

    "Hi!\nJust thought I'd run through a few questions for any experienced terrier people...\n\nFirstly, I have a little experience with Airedales as I regularily dog sit for a pack of 6 of them, but as I haven't lived with them long term, it'd be great to hear more! \n\nI am currently dog sitting for a GSD and lab and when my brother in law came round, his allergies kicked in and he was still coughing the next day...this has meant he won't be able to come round new years and this made me realise I can't be wholly selfish in my type of dog I choose, I need breeds that I can have him round and I can take them round to his for the day. I'm aware that no dogs are 100% allergen free, but I've been doing my research and these seem to be on the list of dogs that produce less dander. I have always liked the smart look of these dogs, but not had the opportunity to meet many, so I'd like the further my research on here if you'll oblidge me \n\nWhat are Irish Terriers like to live with? Do you think an Airedale and Irish (one of each sex) would be a good pairing? \n\nI'm planning to have children in the future, would these dogs be good choices? Do yours mix well with other dogs?\nDo yours recall well? Do they moult at all? Do you find them to be good watchdogs? \n\nOnto the grooming, I have minimal experience with hand stripping from the Airedales, but would like to know what the reality of this is, how long does it take and is it hard to get them looking smart as an amateur? I wouldn't want to clip them as I heard this means more dander will be produced and they lose the rich colour. I've seen a clipped Airedale and she looks older than she is! \n\nI'll leave the questions there for now, just to let you know, this isn't a whim, although I'm not allergic, I don't want to be cut off from my family when I finally have dogs, and its not fair to ask others to suffer. I've always loved the terrier spirit and walked a staffie for 4 years. \n\nYours hopefully\nMelanie",

    "I had a big worry with Chico in January, when I was offline due to internet problems.\n\nOne morning I could see he was just not right - sort of hunched up and obviously in discomfort.  Made an immediate appointment with the Vet, who said he was sure it was some sort of blockage and kept him in for an x-ray.  The x-ray showed a problem between the small and large intestines, and he decided to operate immediately.  He discovered two pieces of chewed up blanket!  He said the smell when he removed them was awful!\n\nAnyway, he is one very lucky little dog to get away with it.  Needless to say, he no longer has that kind of fleecy blanket.\n\nAnd the operation cost more than he did!",

As it is, he has a sock fetish.  I now have to put them straight into the washing machine and shut the door because he extracts them from washing baskets!  He's always been very lucky and they've come out one end or the other, but I don 't want to take any chances!",

    "Hi All,\nI am new here and looking for some advice or experience. My 9 year old female Chihuahua was just diagnosed with a mass on her spleen. It most likely is cancer and if it's not, its a hematoma that will just get bigger and rupture and kill her.  So, it's a lose lose situation.  She is anemic right now and surgery is not an option. The only way it is an option is if its not cancer and she is healthy enough for surgery. I have been researching this and these masses I can't find any cases of a Chihuahua getting this! It is driving me crazy that SHE had to get this! She is the best dog. I also feel guilty since having 3 kids I haven't given her the attention she once got. I am just a mess. Has anyone heard of a Chihuahua getting this?  These are just not on the list for health problems for them. I feel so unlucky with this and she is so unlucky to get this. Mind you, I have had her on the best food growing up and for a while, she has been on Blue Buffalo. She sees her vet yearly, there is no smoking in my house, she doesn't get table food...I just don't know how or why she got this.", 
    "I am so sorry to hear this and apologise that I have no advice for you, except please do not feel guilty that looking after your children might has lessened the attention she once had.\n\nNot knowing anything about this, all I can think is that if it is a haematoma and not cancer, then it possibly was caused by trauma which damaged her spleen.\n\nAll I can do is hope that she will be OK whichever way it goes, and will pray for her.  All you can do is just love her.\n\nI think maybe you could do with some (((hugs))) so they are on the way.", 
    "Oh dear how sad , I second what @Malka said about not feeling guilty. The lovely things about dogs is that their love for you is endless and I'm sure she felt like an important part of your family. I don't have any advice I just hope it isn't cancer and she pulls through. Poor babba", 
    "Thank you. Malka, I thought trauma too as my 2 year old has sat on her a couple times but it's got to be severe trauma like hit by a car, falling out a window, etc. I just brought her back to the vet, I'm lucky if I get a few months with her. They are starting treatment to get her well enough to consider surgery but even with that she may just have 6 months to a year. I'm sick of crying...thank you again both.", 
    "Tara, please do not beat yourself up with \"if only\".  Maybe your toddler did sit on her a couple of times, and maybe bounced a wee bit too hard, but with a tiddler like a Chi it would not take severe trauma to cause spleen damage.  Actually that is severe trauma in itself, especially when you think of the difference in their weights.  And it is not your fault because you cannot watch all of them all the time.  If it is a it is a haematoma then as long as no more trauma/damage is caused it is possible that the haematoma can be absorbed.\n\nIf it is cancer that is something you will have to think about.  How will surgery and whatever treatment might be needed afterwards, affect her day to day living.  Do not forget that you have three small children to cope with, let alone a little dog who will be going through some possibly nasty treatment.\n\nMaybe another six months or even a year will be worth it for you, but with no guarantee that you would even have that with her, you have to think of her well-being as well as your feelings.\n\nAnd yes, I do know how you feel.\n\nMore (((hugs))) are needed I think.", 
    "Yes, you are right, I have lots to consider. I Just found out today it's most likely cancer. But she also has severe anemia and auto immune disease . In order to even consider surgery, she has to get her red blood cells up. She has a 50/50 shot of getting through this part. If she does, surgery can be an option. My head is spinning. Right now I'm just trying to make her comfortable and happy and take it day by day. Thank you for your support.", 
    "I have no magic answers but please try to look after yourself first.  Because you have three small children who need you and you have to be \"with it\" to look after them.  If they sense that your head is spinning because of your little Chi - even very young children can sense when momma is upset about something without knowing what it is.\n\nYou have to be strong for yourself and for your children.  I am not saying that you should not be strong for your little Chi but you are the important one here.  \n\nAnd sometimes fighting the unbeatable only harms both fighters.",

Has anyone heard of a Chihuahua getting this?  These are just not on the list for health problems for them. I feel so unlucky with this and she is so unlucky to get this. Mind you, I have had her on the best food growing up and for a while, she has been on Blue Buffalo. She sees her vet yearly, there is no smoking in my house, she doesn't get table food...I just don't know how or why she got this.Click to expand...\n\nhi Tara I'm a cvt and blown away ! my chihuahua 9.5 years old  just got diagnosed with a splenic mass as well.  it's typically a large breed thing . your the first I've come across with chi too. it's heartbreaking.  I just got Bubbas bloodwork back today . everything is still good on his for now . he's having  surgery next week to remove his spleen", 
    "This is so sad! The cause of this cancer is still unknown. Praying for her.", 
    "Any further news Natasha, has your Chi made a good recovery?", 
    "I did a bit of research before getting my Chihuahua and I'm sure there was no mention of splenic mass.  The diagnosis must have been a real shock and I really hope you can give us good news.", 
    "Chihuahuas are so cute.", 
    "They are - have you got one?", 
    "On my profile, it says I have one and I have a chihuahua/dachshund mix. So yes.",

    "We are looking to expand our canine family soon and I have been considering getting a Chihuahua or a Chihuahua mix.  Not sure about this because I have not owned such a small dog and have read horror stories about hypoglycemia and such.  I also have a soon to be 5 year old daughter, and hesitate to get such a small dog with her.  She is not overly boisterous and is pretty well behaved but she still is almost 5.  That said, I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts?  There is something that is attracting me to these little cuties though I am wary.  Thanks!!", 
    "I think a pug, Staffie or Frenchie/Boston would be better for you as Chihuahua's can be snappy round young children", 
    "I have a nine month old Chihuahua, Chico, and all I can say is I wish I'd got one years ago!\n\nAfter I'd reserved him, I was having doubts about having such a tiny dog, and was convinced I'd be having to take extra care of him and be very careful to make sure the others (Standard Poodle and Cocker Spaniel) didn't hurt him.  I needn't have worried - he's like a miniature Pit Bull, and if there is a tug of war over a toy, he always wins.\n\nI worried myself sick about hypogycemia, and even went to the vet before I got him asking if they stocked a product (can't remember what it's called) which you give them if they show symptoms, but they told me not to worry.  The breeder gave me a bottle of runny honey in case it was needed, but he's never had any problems.\n\nThe important thing is to treat any Chihuahua like a dog and choose your breeder with care, not one who tries to produce the tiniest puppies they can.  There is a breeder near here who doesn't use pens or cages and says the puppies are 'raised underfoot' which sounds good!\n\nDifficult to say whether one would be suitable for a little girl.  I think my son (who is now in his thirties!) would have been perfectly trustworthy with a tiny dog, but I did foster other children and I certainly wouldn't have trusted some of them to be gentle enough.  Perhaps if you could ring some breeders and see what they have to say.\n\nThey really are unique little dogs.", 
    "Thanks for the reply.  I am sure going to do more research and keep my eyes open for the perfect fur baby!  Thanks again!", 
    "Before I had Gwylim I had a 9 pound Tibetan Spaniel who although she liked to play with young children, didn't like to be picked up by one.  The problem I found was because she was small and fluffy every small child wanted to pick her up and treat her like a cuddly toy. \n\nI now have a 18 pound Miniature Schnauzer who adores children. I've watched him with his breeder's 7 year old daughter whom he allows to lug around in the most undignified manner and it doesn't seem to bother him at all judging by the way he's always ready for more!", 
    "As a retired Chihuahua breeder I can tell you that they are unique in some ways the same as every breed has unique qualities. Personally I have never had a mean or snappy Chihuahua come from one of my litters. But I also rescue the same today as I always have and there are times I come across those that are mean and snappy. Most of the time these behaviors are largely the result of some kind of abuse and/or neglect. I've always been able to train it out of them by first gaining their trust and then teaching the correct behavior. There are also times when bad traits are the result of bad breeding practices. That is a lot harder to deal with. Keep in mind, too, that a 3 lb. Chihuahua may not be a good choice around small children only because no matter how gentle your child may be accidents do happen. Mine range from 3 to 12 pounds. 12 pounds is large for a chi with 6 being about the norm. Mine all readily accept almost anyone who is gentle with them. None are really crazy about much larger dogs, because they have typical little dog syndrome and want to prove that big does not make you the boss. They are a hardy breed often living to 15 to 18 yrs. old.", 
    "they are lovely little dogs but they are not keen on young children I have a 14 year old daughter and Ebony belongs to her so they can get on with young children but they seem to know their own vulnerability and the british Chihuahua club recommends they do not share homes with children younger than 12", 
    "Yeah...I actually have thought about this and am not going to get one until my daughter is much older.  Thanks for the advice!  Even though she is respectful of animals I wouldn't want to put the dog under needless stress.  That said, we are still looking for our next fur baby!", 
    "Few owners in my family. Some can have issues but I don't think that is proper behavior. As those in my family have been great all around they are basically bad warmers and don't snap at the small children.", 
    "Lots of Chihuahuas can get on with young children my Chihuahua doesn't snap at them she is just very scared but she does love older children who approach her kindly and let her sniff them first If your young child is sensible then it could work out I recommend speaking to a breeder to see what they think xx", 
    "That's what I think too. It depends on the child and dog. I've seen some scared, even a couple scared of older kids adults. Those were on the timid side at first of meeting people. Others I've seen not so scared and the ones in my family have been with small kids so they are great. I used to always think them yappy snappy dogs before.", 
    "I used to think that as well until my daughter crazed me for one!! but it does depend on the individual I think as long as it brought up from puppyhood to be around children their less likely to snap or become timid", 
    "For sure. Socialization and breeding cam be important. Then like you said the child. Both my boys were easier on the dogs. When my oldest was 3 my mom's Chi would sit with him and also nap with him. My other son was around her since a baby and they were fine together, she didn't mind being around him at all and he was more gentle with her. My daughter totally different story, she has to be watched with small dogs and pups. She is learning and being taught properly but she still has tendency to grab their skin, want to carry them around or pull them around. My mom's dog hasn't ever snapped and she's never hurt the dog it is just she's such a small dog you have to make sure to keep an eye.", 
    "socialization is important for sure it was very hard to socialize our chi as we live in a village with only a few houses and shops but she has learnt to get along with children as long as they don't pick her up or pull her about I think as long as introductions are monitored by the parents then they should get along well with kids there's a Chihuahua called pip in the village and he is child obsessed he goes running over licking them and jumping about wagging his tail simply because his owner has seven children! I don't think that anyone should be put off them just because they have a young child if they like the breed then go for it! but just keep an eye on things to make sure that child and dog are safe and happy", 
    "my little girl in her pink 'eskimo' coat as we like to call it she is looking forward to wearing it again next winter", 
    "Aww cute little Chi - I'm sure that will keep her warm in winter", 
    "Very glamorous!  I am sure my Chihuahua Chico would be most impressed by such a lovely girl!", 
    "she is definitely warm underneath that and she is a little charmer with the males!",

    "The dogs were mooching about in the sunshine, when I noticed Chico was missing.  Kept calling, kept looking - nothing.  I was getting a bit frightened because I'd put some washing in the washing machine, including a giant size duvet cover.  Supposing he'd curled up inside the pile of washing and I'd put him in the machine?!  He's so light I probably wouldn't have noticed.  I was peering at the washing going round, wondering whether to try and wrench the door open, when I heard a scratching - he'd somehow shut himself in the downstairs loo.\n\nPhew! Though I think it will make me check where he is in future when I shove a pile of clothes in the machine.",

    "The courts took a heavily pregnant young 9 month old Chihuahua & an 10 month old male Chihuahua off a pet hoarder 13 weeks ago, since then they have been living with one of The Rescue Home fosterers the bitch had 6 puppies but only 3 survived, now that the puppies including both parents have had all their jabs I am introducing them to other puppies & older dogs.\nThe foster told me to keep an eye on Usain Bolt {this pup is the smallest only 2 inches high, but boy is super fast hence the name} I took all 5 pups [mum & dad are still puppies to me] to the playroom & bought in Jamie a lovely 8 month old Rottweiler puppy.\nUsain Bolt went straight up to Jamie & nicked his ragdoll off him, {the ragdoll is 4 times bigger then Bolt}  then Usain Bolt stood daring Jamie to take the ragdoll off him, {Usain Bolt is going to be big trouble for who ever adopts him} Jamie the big softy sulked off to other side of room so I took his ragdoll off Usain Bolt & gave it back to Jamie as Usain Bolt has got to learn he can't take what not his.\nBecause it's sunny today I opened the playroom patio doors so the puppies can play outside, zoom as soon as the doors were open Usain Bolt was gone & so was the poor spider that he had killed & was trying to eat [yuk] not only is he only 2 inches high he's a spider killer, 5 minutes later the little terror had found a small gap in fence & was bolting across yard as super fast speed, bang I hit the dog loose emergency button on my walkie talkie, both main gates slammed shut, car park gate shut & every member of staff & volunteers came running to catch the escape puppy, it looked like an scene from Keystone cops, staff & volunteers with tea towels [can't use the slip leads on a 2 inch high puppy] trying to catch Usain Bolt, it was a great big game to the little terror dodging the tea towels & after 47 minutes 21 seconds he decided to go to his foster mum wagging his little tail, who quickly picked him up & what did Usain Bolt do he just fell fast asleep in her hand.",

    "Had an unexpected trip to the vet this morning. \n\nWe'd had our normal walk and were nearly home, all three dogs on the lead, when a cockapoo spotted them and came racing over, his whole body wriggling in excitement.  Somehow he knocked into Chico, and hurt his front leg.  I waited for about an hour and he was still not putting any weight on it, so rang the vet and they said to bring him straight over.\n\nThe vet thinks he's injured his shoulder ligaments, and gave him an anti-inflammatory injection - he said if it was a person he'd say to rest for a few days, but obviously that's not going to happen!  He doesn't think he'll need to see him again but obviously I'm to take him if I'm concerned.\n\nHe had to put Chico on the floor to see how he was walking, and we had an amusing few minutes with the vet trying to catch him afterwards, in spite of his gammy leg!\n\nSeems strange that yesterday he was running along with the Dogue de Bordeaux and the Mastiff without being hurt, and today he was hurt by an over enthusiastic cockapoo!  I think incidents like this will happen - an occupation hazard of being a Chihuahua.  I don't want to start carrying him everywhere or avoiding other dogs, or, even worse, not taking him out for fear of being injured.",

    "Thanks Carole and Malka.  At the moment he is absolutely fine, with not the slightest hint of a limp or any discomfort.  But of course, when the effect of the injection wears off it might be a different story.\n\nBut at least the vet seems satisfied that there's nothing to worry about - so fingers crossed he's right!",

I think my breeder does try to make sure hers go to people who are going to treat them as dogs.  Also, she has taken the precaution of giving the phone number and postcode of a friend who lives about twenty miles away as she is fairly isolated and is worried about them being stolen.  She has  put off one person who enquired about the puppies - she was convinced this person was planning to resell it at twice the price.

They also need to be given regular daily exercise to ensure they remain fit and healthy. On top of this, dogs need to be fed good quality food that meets all their nutritional needs throughout their lives.\n\nGrooming\nThe Smooth Collie has a short, close lying double coat which consists of a harsher top coat and a denser undercoat. They are low maintenance on the grooming front with a weekly brush and wipe over with a chamois leather is all it takes to keep their coats tidy and in good condition.\nThey shed steadily throughout the year only more so during the Spring and then again in the Autumn when more frequent grooming is usually necessary to stay on top of things and to remove dead and shed hair from a dog's coat. It's also important to check a dog's ears on a regular basis and to clean them when necessary. If too much wax is allowed to build up, it can lead to a painful infection which can be hard to clear up. In short, prevention is often easier than cure with ear infections.\n\nHope this helps you,\nJane\nxx", 
    "They shed relatively heavily, yep.\nThink labrador or german shepherd type", 
    "I have been seeiously considering the Smooth Collie.  I like the Collie disposition but I would like a dog that I can take out in the yard and play.. Obviously,  Colliies are not retrievers, so I'm guessing fetch is off the table.  So, what types of play activities do they enjoy?", 
    "I love Smooth Collies and don't understand why they are not more popular.\nOf all the breeds that I have had, the hardest to teach to retrieve were show line Golden Retrievers - though they loved carrying soft toys around! Most breeds of dog love any games that involve chase, bite, (squeakers and chews), tug and carry.

Fortunately over the years have managed without the dogs having to go into Kennels.

    "Chances are your vet's suggestions will break down into two categories: core pet vaccines and non-core vaccines.\n\nAmong pet caretakers few topics are more debated than that regarding the vaccination of dogs (and cats).

I know someone who bought a supposed ISDS registered BC puppy-he had terrible CEA & was in all essence blind-his father was a well know stud dog who had never before produced a puppy with CEA-DNA tests were done & the ISDS was not the father. Now according to you the puppy was a BC because it looked like a BC, but the father was of unknown breed(no other BC's males on the property),but the DNA showed otherwise. Any dog with a BC/RC/SS/ASD/NSDTR in it's pedigree(& probably other breeds)could be a carrier of CEA so the puppy could in fact be a X breed.\n\r\nThe ISDS call all the dogs registered with them WSD(or BC)& unless you are desperate to show your dogs in breed or breed from them to produce BC's for the show ring. It really doesn't matter what the KC calls them. It is not a name for a dog that works sheep in the eyes of the KC it is what they call dogs of the BC type that do not have  parents that are ISDS/KC(full) registered parents. QED\n\n\r\nThe only reason I would not have a litter by a KC reg WSD from Jessie is not snobbery, but the other breeds that are behind most WSDs. I will(if she ever comes in season)be using an ISDS dog to get back to her breeding's roots\n\r\nSo to get back to the topic of the posting-if a dog is KC reg as a BC or WSD they qualify if they are the highest placed dog of this \"type\"in the class. All the others qualify if they are the highest placed dog in their catagory.\n\r\nE.G. an ASD x BC is a X breed(not a WSD)\r\na KC reg WSD x BC is not a X breed the KC class them as WSD",

    "Welcome to the forum Erika & Co.", 
    "Hi everyone,;-) \r\nSo I am new here and I am new to dog world. A few months ago I have decided that I am (finally!!) ready for a dog. I am interested in two breeds and have already found and contacted few breeders in europe however, I would love to find at least one breeder in UK. This has proved to be very hard though! I have found several Australian shepherd breeders on internet however all of them only provide emails and phone numbers. None of UK breeders (for both breeds that i am interested in) seem to have webpages. I'm curious why is that? It's so easy to find breeders online from any country around europe (and beyond) however, when looking for breeders around here it's virtually impossible. Before anyone asks why I don't just email or call the breeders - I like to look at websites of various kennels. I enjoy doing my own research by looking at their dogs who they breed or owned in the past, their health test results, photos, litters, shows etc. Yes, I could ask the breeder to send me photos through email but I believe that serious breeders go that extra mile and do everything to inform the public of their activities.\n\r\nSo I guess what I am trying to ask here is: \r\n1. Does anyone know of any UK Australian shepherd breeders?\r\n2. Why is it so unpopular to have a kennel website in UK? Don't want to sound mean but isn't it sort of backwards?.. It's 21st century and people should use every way to promote their breed/ kennel/ dog lines?", 
    "Hi Kristina\n\r\nBe sure to check out our breed profile: Australian Shepherd Information.\n\r\nAlso take a look at this recent thread: Australian Shepherd\n\r\nRe breeders websites.. hopefully that'll change when we launch Breedia  in the meantime Google should return a few",

Click to expand...\n\nSome of the best breeders in the UK (if not the world) do not have websites.\n\r\nThey do not need them.\n\r\nSome have websites which are very basic.\n\r\nThey do not need to seek customers, clients seek them out.\n\r\nAlso the sophistication of some websites are in inverse ratio to the achievements of the breeder! \n\r\nThe best place to start for information on any breed is the relevant breed club(s) which for the ASD are:\n\nhttp://australianshepherdnasa.com/\n\nhttp://www.ascuk.co.uk/\n\r\nThe ASD is very popular in the UK with some top winning show dogs, Obedience Champions, Working Trials Champion and one Dual Ob/WT Champions. \n\r\nThe Kennel Club has a health test finder where you can look up the results of any ASD provided you know its kennel name.\n\r\nI know several breeders and handlers of the ASD in the UK, if I can be of any help let me know.", 
    "Hi and welcome to Dogsey.\n\nIn my breed it is often the breed club you go to to find good breeders some do have web sites but they don't necessarily advertise litters but the dogs they have are there on the site pictures information their show career etc.,\n\nThis way you find out when their fun days are and shows are go along to meet breeders people who own the breed and can give you recommendations and also to meet the dogs in the flesh which is always a good thing.\n\nYou will find the people in the breed club have many years exeprience in the breed and are always happy and willing talk about the breed most are happy for you to give them a ring or drop an email asking questions.\n\nGood luck keep us posted.",

    "Does anyone on here own an Australian Shepherd - what are they like to live with?  What are their personalities like?  How similar/different are they to border collies?  Any info much appreciated x",

    "A friend of ours has one.  He's absolutely gorgeous lol but is very, very lively and is as strong as an Ox!  \n\r\nIf he swung his bum at you - you would go flying! \n\r\nHis owner is a dog trainer and yet he admitted that when reaching 'teenage' years his dog was a real handful. Still; Sunny (dog's name!) is pretty obedient and certainly knows his commands. In fact; he went through the whole routine of the commands he knows in about 2 minutes in an attempt to get the cocktail sausage his owner was holding!  \n\r\nThe owners wife struggles to take him out as he is sooo strong on lead and their sofa / house has sustained a *lot* of damage from him lol.  He was a rogue as a young dog too - he stole things left, right and centre lol and was generally very naughty! But you look into his eyes and you melt!   He is very friendly!! xx",

    "I like the Miniature Aussies (aka Miniature North American Shepherds) after meeting someone 12 years ago in the USA who bred them.\n\nIf I was looking for a smaller dog for agility, HWTM or flyball, that's what I'd go for - all the ability and scope of the BC, but the size of a Cocker Spaniel. The only comparable breed is the Sheltie, but I do not want all the coat.",

    "Australian Shepherds are one of the more common breeds around here - I have several friends who own them and enjoy the breed immensely, although I never foresee myself owning one. They are excellent all around dogs, very versatile and an excellent candidate for sport/performance and just a general active lifestyle. Very fun, many of them seem to possess a sense of humor, for lack of a better term. The average well bred Australian Shepherd could really easily be a great performance dog and companion/pet. Many breeders around here strive to produce working dogs with the conformation to remain functional and succeed in the show ring, and have produced just that for generations.\n\r\nThe one trait I hear from everyone regarding Australian Shepherds, especially in comparison to German Shepherds and Border Collies, is that they are very \"bouncy\". Pushy and in-your-face but happy, happy, happy. Goofy and playful, although they can also be exceptionally dignified. Most Aussies I've met love to talk. Just highly amiable dogs, overall great with other dogs and people. I have heard from a friend or two that their dogs aren't the best to have around kids (whereas my German Shepherd is very sensitive to children), but I think the breed overall can do well with them.", 
    "Just been looking on the net and stumbled upon a Miniature Australian Shepherd breeder in Shropshire.\n\r\nI've not seen this breed before (are they an actual breed?) anyone know anything about them?", 
    "Oh no not making something else miniature surely.", 
    "Thanks for the link.  I do not understand why they feel they have to   miniaturise the breed they are not overly large dogs to begin with.  Bigger than collies granted but no bigger than a Goldie.",

    "The dogs in your link are lovely ;-)  I take Ted to be groomed by the breeder", 
    "Are they the same as standard Aussies, just smaller?\n\r\nThe faces look slightly different to full sized Aussies, and look to have a little less coat (or possibly just well groomed?)", 
    "Not sure I have owned an Aussie cross but he didn't have the Aussie coat but I do know if I was to look for a pedigree Aussie I would want the full size one.", 
    "I think I would for a full size one as well if I were to go for an Aussie.\r\nThese minis seem to be doing well at Agility though, I've not heard of them before, just interesting as they are in my county", 
    "Miniature Aussies are not recognised by the breed clubs.\n\r\nHere is the statement by ASCUK:\n\n\"The Australian Shepherd Club of the UK does not support the recent influx of 'Miniature Australian Shepherds' or certain individuals attempts to register 'Miniature Australian Shepherds' with the Kennel Club as Australian Shepherds. \n\r\nThe Australian Shepherd does not have breed 'varieties' and therefore does not recognise the Miniature Australian Shepherd or any other variety. \n\r\nSince these dogs are not recognised in their country of origin USA by the American Kennel Club, then they cannot be verified as purebred dogs and should NOT be sold or purchased as such.\"", 
    "They have existed in the USA for a long time though and are popular in Europe.\n\nI saw some over 10 years ago when I visited a friend's aunt in the USA who happened to breed them. She had about 7 of them and I thought they were lovely. One or two of her dogs are at the back of the pedigree of the UK imports.\n\nI have no problem with them as they are more Sheltie sized ideally, and if you didn't want a Sheltie (too much coat, perhaps) then these are ideal.",

Pretty much guarantee NO - because what decent ethical breeder in the breed would agree to having any of their dogs used\n\r\nThey are either crossing to another breed (have heard of people crossing paps and collies to make mini collies) Which I strongly disagree with as you cannot know what you are actully going to get out of each litter so there will be a whole lot of waste\n\r\nOR\r\nyou are just breeding small to small then picking the smallest from that litter\n\r\nSo if you are breeding for size then you are not breeding the best to the best, not breeding for health or temprament or working ability\n\r\nTo spend all that time and waste all that life just to produce a dog who MAY make your jumps lower for your flyball team\r\nespecially when there are so many amazing crosses in rescue",

    "Family split up , 10 months old ..\n\n\n.The fosters update ...\nMaxi has been with me for a few weeks now. He is such a beautiful boy and I am completely smitten with him. I am 100% sure that this lovely boy is a Blue Merle Australian Shepherd, but that is just my personal opinion. He is clean in the house and ok to be left for reasonable periods of time. He sleeps quietly at night and is very sociable with all dogs male and female. He is great with children but small ones may get knocked over by him whilst he is playing. Maxi could be rehomed as an only dog in the right circumstances but ideally he needs another playful dog to keep him company. He needs an active home where he gets an hour a day minimum off lead walking. His recall is fabulous but like most dogs he is slightly nosey. Maxi really needs a home without cats as he will chase and become quite obsessed with them. If you are interested in offering this gorgeous boy a home then please research the breed first. Just like the Collie breed, he needs mental and physical stimulation or he may become bored and find his own amusement.", 
    "well apart from the colouring, he definitely doesn't look like an Aussie to me.  Whatever, he is very cute and I hope he finds his new forever home soon.", 
    "Aww poor boy. He is still young so may look different in a year or so? I can see why she said auzzie but all the ones I have seen have been way more chunky, up here there arnt that many auzzie breeders so I would be surprised to see one\nHope he gets a good home quickly", 
    "My friend breeds ASDs & they look nothing like him.\n\r\nHe looks like a cross collie TBH",

    "Neither, he's a mutt.", 
    "Does not look like either to me and I have met my fair share of both breeds.", 
    "Doesn't look anything like an Aussie.  I would agree with the others and say collie cross.",

  "Clumber Spaniel": [
    "THE OWNER of the only Clumber Spaniel at Blackpool ch show refused to accept the best of breed award because she did not want him to undergo the high-profile breed veterinary check.\n\n  The dog involved was Marjorie Charlesworth-Ironside\u2019s Tavirosh Old Yeller, who is 18 months old. Two Clumbers were entered at the show but the other did not take part.\n\n  Mrs Charlesworth-Ironside told DOG WORLD that when Clumbers were added to the high-profile list she vowed never to put her dogs through one.\n\n\"I\u2019m very fussy about who touches my dogs and which vet I go to,\u201d she said.\n\n\"We were all very upset that the Kennel Club had hit the Clumber with the double whammy of not only being a vulnerable breed but also being on the high-profile list. We had a meeting and everybody was very unhappy that our breed had been chosen as the only gundog breed to go on the list. The Clumber is a good, healthy breed. \n\n  \"I didn\u2019t have a best of breed-winning dog at the time, but I said that when I did I wouldn\u2019t let any vet I didn\u2019t know go over it.

    "I'm going to echo what Alf has said. It's unsusual for a good breeder to have two puppies immediately available, as most of them have a waiting list.\n\nYou also need to be very careful with Clumbers and insist both parents are hip and eye scored, especially as the Clumber has one of the highest (and therefore potentially most damaging) hip scores of all breeds.\n\nI would also like to warn that there are many puppy dealers around who take puppy farmed dogs, and pass them off as their own (or even admit they are bred elsewhere). Avoid with the biggest bargepole you can find!\n\nThen there is the unusual situation that they are willing to let you have two. Almost ALL ethical breeders with their puppies' future welfare in mind, will NOT sell two from the same litter. There are far too many potential behavioural issues which can occur further along the line.\n\nDid you find this breeder through the Clumber Spaniel club?\nIs the breeder willing to give you lifetime support for the pups, and willing and able to take them back at any time in the future if things don't work out, or your circumstances change?\n\nThese are just a few of the questions I would be asking.",

    "Hi,\nWe are bringing home our new bullmastiff puppy tomorrow. He is a male named \"Lenny\" and is a purebred. We have three children the youngest is 2year old and this is our first pup. The breeders have children so i'm hoping this will mean that Lenny feels socially comfortable around children. Does anyone have any unique or great tips that have helped with house training their new puppy.? do you think that puppy preschool is imperative to their social growth? we want Lenny to be a beautiful sooky cuddly house member, not a overly protective aggressive guard dog. He is our new family member so we want him to grow and fit in comfortably. do you think that treat training is good or just the use of words i.e. no and good? Just a few questions for real owners out there and what you think has worked.!\nThank you all in advance. This forum is going to help getting great information for our new child!", 
    "Welcome to the forum Salben and, (currently), little Lenny. \n\nMy best tip for housetraining is to be sure that you pop him outside after every drink, every meal, and every sleep. Watch his body language, is he looking for a place to 'go'? Use a special word - I say Quicky, and be prepared to stand there with him until he obliges. A short happy word, (Yes!), paired with a treat, will show him that he has done the right thing. I see that you have young children, and it can be hard to keep your eye on everyone at the same time, so I have sometimes resorted to putting a couple of cat bells on a puppy collar, to warn me that they have woken up.\nSocialisation is very important, I would want him to have as many happy experiences as possible while he is at this impressionable age.\nThere are a variety of training methods, but do choose a positive reinforcement type. Clicker training is highly rated, but it can be a muddle to manipulate a lead, a treat, and a clicker box. I find the, short happy 'Yes!' + treat, can work just as well. \n\nI'm afraid that I have no special breed knowledge to offer, but I'm sure one of our Bull breed fans will be along soon.", 
    "Agree with all Carole has said and would add not to forget children training \n\nAs this is your first pup, it is important for your children to learn to respect the pup which includes not pulling him about, over-hugging him and very importantly to respect his space when he needs to rest", 
    "thank you both for your reply. we have had a few accidents but we are starting to know his routine after that and have had 3 successful outdoor toilet episodes with rewards. I have picked up that 20mins after he drinks he wee's so thats a start. we are definitely teaching the kids to respect his space when sleeping. Do either of you believe in crate training at night for his sleeping? as in he has a area that is enclosed, (not fully roof enclosed) to go to when its bed or rest time? i have found that he wanders to different areas, not his specific bed area to sleep, so we have made him a temp wooden sleep box you could call it for a sleep and toilet for overnight. I can't think of anything else as he sleeps in the living area of our house as our laundry is under the house. thanks",

    "His first night was a success. He didn't whimper or cry at all (I was prepared for it). We had him in like a timber cot style bed to sleep in and he did one small wee on the pad. I had to do this as I am learning the steps of having a puppy and a open bed he didn't seem secure in. I have 3 children and thats easy to me, a puppy is a different story. If he is not in a crate style area for sleeping or small gated area, i'm not sure how I teach him to go to bed at night and stay there. If he wasn't secure he would wander and I would be up all night watching him. I have done plenty of research on mastiff puppies, his food and needs etc I'm just finding small things tricky and like ideas of how others have done it. \nI feed him under an outside area and i'm not sure why i do this i guess it was habit, keeping the young 2 year old away from him why he eats. Although I know that i have to teach him eventually with taking away his food while eating and give back to train him around the kids. He eats premium dog biscuits ATM and he doesn't eat the recommended amount (which is ok i know we all eat differently) although he tends to walk away then come back for more a minute later. Then walks away and comes back again. He never just stays and eats. so dinner time takes a while. Is this what puppies do and then eventually they just eat constantly until full at dinner time?\n My routine and ideas I had planned have gone out the window when we brought him home, as text book doesn't always suit everyones lifestyle. I will have to find a area inside then that I can put his water. We have a gated lounge room for our child and Lenny seems to hang with us all so he doesnt really have readily access to the whole house as we want to be able to watch him with toilet trainig. we take him out every hour to wee and drink or when he shows signs of either. I wil have to think of a better plan. its all about learning as I go. He seems super happy and content so thats the most important thing. Thanks again for your help.",

    "Well for the past 2 weeks Phoebe has been having a holiday romance with a rottie that has been on a barge on our section on the canal. His back legs have gone so hes on a wheelie frame. She is so nice with him and gentle so she must know she cant rough house with him. Every morning she gets on his boat for a quick hello and he tags along with us for 5 mins or so of our walk. This morning as we arrive on canal his boat goes past us Phoebe darts for it and it takes me and my hubby to stop us all going in the canal. She then howled. It was the saddest thing ild ever seen. The boat pulled over to let them have one last walk and then was gone. In all the drama of it i didnt think to take their number or even ask if they live far. So Phoebe and Bruno are no more and Phoebe has been ok but think we may have a problem in the  morning when shes looking for his boat (this has happened before with the black pudding lady, she looked for at least a week for that boat once it had gone)",

    "Im going to keep a bit of a photo diary on my shrinking dog. Phoebes weight has been a bit up and down since November last year but only going a kilo down then back then down, now the problem has escalated and were are 4kg down and i think may have gone a bit more. Vet is putting this down to kennel stress at the moment as we have no other explanation. Phoebe has been a regular at the kennels i work at for 3 years as i also work in events and during summer Phoebe spends friday to monday in kennels. This hasnt happened the past 2 summers so not sure why she is finding being at kennels stressfull this time but i have noticed she is a bit more reliant on me for support this past 7-9 months. I now have 3 weeks at home as just doing local events so will be home every night and i have an army of friends helping so i dont need to put her in kennels even for a day over this next 3 weeks. I plan on fattening her up a bit so that when she does go in the kennels in 3 weeks time she can afford to lose a little weight if it happens.  The rule book about feeding has gone out the window now and im just doing what i think is best for my dog, as nobody knows her better than me.",

But i also met a very nice man on a dog food stand (he was a trainer). He was telling me that he thinks the food just doesnt match Phoebe so shes not absorbing what she needs from the food, he said its the only explanation he can come up with if tests are fine and her poops have been bigger since on this food (it is now a 2 hand job) he recommended a different brand of food or going back to our old food if we didnt have any problems when on that. I spoke to him about the fact shes bloating all the time on an average of 3 times a week now aswell and thats is causing me stress and im sure Phoebe is not happy about it. Nothing has changed to cause this. He did say this could also be down to the fact shes lost lots of weight so not enough fat and muscle support around her tummy to keep it all in right place and moving at right pace. What he said did make sense. he recommended a food called Robbies by \"the land of holistic pets\" (he didnt sell this by the way) he said its dehydrated and has to be soaked for 10 mins before eating, shouldnt bloat on this food, completely hypo-allergenic and due to what it is made from Phoebes poop should be reduced by half and if it isnt i should speak to vet about non obsession of nutrients. \n\nAnybody heard of this food? anybody got any thoughts on what this man has told me?",

    "As many of you already know Phoebe has skin problems, they are the bain of our life. Her problem is that she makes to much yeast on her skin and ears and this causes a problem and sometimes a secondary infection. Our previous plan of action was bath a fortnight with malaseb, yeast eater supplement in feed, weekly ear cleaning. We would get the odd outbreak where baths and ear cleaning had to be done more often and there would usually be a course of antibiotics. As this plan worked we didnt see a reason to change it untill we lost our pet insurance . So since February we have been working on a new plan to get Phoebe ok without so much expensive help from the vets. Going grain free has worked pretty well and ive been able to stop the yeast eater supplements and went 3 weeks between baths with the use of our homemade 10% tea tree spray. I then tried the new shampoo, its tea tree and should be amazing for her skin i use tea tree products myself and think they are great. But no Phoebe has come out in hives so were on piriton for a week and will no doubt end up with an expensive course of antibiotics as its durin these outbreaks she gets the secondary infection. I have a couple of reasons i dont want to use malaseb 1) i get 3 baths to a bottle, 2) it doesnt lather, 3) she doesnt feel or smell that clean after. 4) you have to try and leave it on for 10 mins making bath time no fun for phoebe, 5) its really expensive\n\nDoes anybody have any recommendations for a really natural shampoo?

She really enjoys it. No adverse reactions as yet but vet says i cant claim \"all clear\" till we pass 6 weeks. Her poop is normal if slightly firmer than before. Ears are pale pink and lovely ( i keep kissing them as first time in ages they not been red or sore or dirty ) No new hives but waiting for old ones to clear up.

    "As dog owners we are all in search of the perfect poop from our pets. Now phoebe has had what i believe to be perfect poop  for years. Firm yet soft. formed, easy to pick up. Now after 9 days on the grain free her poop is still hard. It doesnt come as one anymore. Its a few hard logs.\n\nWould you say that is ok? is that normal for a dog on grain free? She drinks a lot of water so its not that. Just cant decide if this means the food is not the right one for us.",

Bit like Goldilocks and the Three Bears porridge, its got to be \"just right\" or I start to worry! \n\nFrom what you've said in another thread about the improvement of Phoebe's skin since changing her over to grain free I'd say there's nothing wrong with the kibble you're giving her ... just needs a little adjustment to get the consistency of her poo right.  Try adding some fibre in the form of veggies to the kibble ... pumpkin is good ... but make sure you introduce them in small quantities at first to give her body time to adjust.  Salmon oil  added to her kibble will also help.\n\nToo many raw bones can cause constipation and hard poo, so if Phoebe has them regularly it might be an idea to restrict the size or number of bones she's given each week.\n\nHope that helps!",

She does eat a lot of bone as her second meal is either turkey neck or a chicken back, but those bones are softer than, say, ribs, and she also has a lot of very lightly steamed vegetables, and she never has any problems straining to go.\n\nShe also has grains, but whole grains only, never any processed grains, as I add a couple of heaped tsp to her \"wet\" meal.  If her poo is ever soft I would be concerned in case something was not right.",

Im giving her a few more days to get used to it before i start the weekly egg, 2 times a week fish thing. also looking in to a new pro-biotic as i dont think i need the acidophilus  anymore if were grain free and i dont even think its helping anymore so going to look at a all round pro-biotic. think with all that i should be pretty confident she has everything she needs.",

Took her to vet but she couldnt jump in boot of car so went on back seat. Vet said she had a really high temp for no reason she could work out as no tummy problems, ear were fine, skin was fine and no wounds could be found. later that day she was ok and eating then on the temp checks over next 4 days were perfectly normal so again the vet has no explanation\n\nwent for injections last monday and found phoebe has lost 1.5 kg again for no reason. we are being weighed again in a week to see if anymore lost. im not allowed to feed any extra or do anything about it so i dont affect the results.\n\nEverything seams to be getting classed as old age.

There is a puppy version, in adults it can clear up spontaneously   .\n\nChloe had it recently and it cleared up without treatment .  I took her to the vet to confirm my diagnosis and  as she was fit and well we decided to leave and observe.\n\nI washed and dried the vaginal area daily in boiled warm water and dried it throughly to keep it clean and to prevent her licking and introducing bacteria to the area.\n\nIt is always a good idea to get any discharge checked by a vet and of course if a bitch is not spayed this should be done ASAP in case it could be caused by pyometra.", 
    "well we are back from vets. We have a weeks worth of antibiotics. vet says more than likely vaginitis but then started going on about something called a stump pyometra. if discharge gone in a week then all good dont worry, if not we go back with a urine sample and then maybe a blood test this could then lead on to a scan  i herd my credit card cry a little at this point. If the discharge starts to change colour over the course of this week then i have to take her in as a matter of urgency. She said i can bath the area with hibiscrub if i want. I had  this with phoebe as a pup but that was yellow goo and she had a horrible rash vet said she hadnt learnt to clean herself so i had to do it for her till she cottoned on. I was happy to take the antibiotics as her skin and ears also playing up for months no matter what i do so hopefully it will help kick that in to shape. \nRegarding weight loss she has to be weighed every week for a month and then they will decide what to do at end of month. So weighed again today and half a kg down from last week but vet said thats not a huge concern right now as to small an amount over to small an amount of time to see if its a pattern. \n\nonly problem i have is i cant decide if they just making things sound dramatic as they know im a good cash cow as im a natural worrier. they had \u00a310k out of my insurance alone over the 71/2 years",

My mum does NOT like the breed, though she does like my three   They are incredibly loyal and loving with their people and are very outgoing as pups.  Maya (now 3) is friendly with everyone, never aggressive, but she can take or leave most people.  She loves me and only me but she always welcomes new people to the house and makes a fuss of them.  They're very \"busy\" dogs and love to have all the focus on them!!  They can be a bit difficult with other dogs they dont know and dont often like strange dogs approaching their bed/crate but they are very loyal to their \"packs\".  Maya has helped me hand rear a chihuahua pup (still looks after it like its her baby and Evie's now 15 months!!!) and she plays very well with the tiniest of chi pups to the largest of labradors",

    "After Merry's walk on Friday - only about one mile, and on the flat - she was very reluctant to get out of the car. In the afternoon she had another bout of back pain, so I rang the vet and made an appointment for Saturday. She was given a very thorough neurological check-up, and apart from a single pain response on one lumbar vertebra, she did not show any sign of a disc damage. We were sent home with moderate pain control, (Metacam and Pardale), and instructions to restrict her activity. She had a follow-up appointment for early Monday morning, and I was told to starve her in case she had to on the CAT scanner. Mummy panic!\nHowever, by Sunday she had recovered again, and on Monday the vet could find nothing wrong - though she is still on medication, and that could possibly mask symptoms. Today, (Tuesday), we tried another one mile level walk, and there were no ill effects, in fact, we are having a real job preventing her ladyship from doing all her normal bouncing and jumping up.\nI am at a real loss to know how Merry could have injured herself. For obvious reasons, I never put her over jumps the week before a show, and she has had no collisions. It is possible that she could have slithered off a knee, or jumped out of the car awkwardly, and she does have a habit of 'pinging' off the kitchen units. Whatever, this week will be aimed at maintaining steady low level exercise, the gradual reduction of her medication, and the firm wish that we will have no further relapses. I am hopeful that Merry's demeanour suggests that we really have it beaten this time.", 
    "Whatever Merry did to have injured herself, I doubt she will tell you.  She probably does not know herself, but how do you stop a dog from bouncing and jumping up?  \n\nI hope that whatever it was has now well and truly gone and that Merry will never have any more relapses.\n\nHuggles for her and for Eddie, and maybe another hug for you?", 
    "You probably will recall that Eddie was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis about 20 months ago. At that time we were warned that those dogs which did not respond to drug treatment or dietary change, often went on to develop bowel cancers. In spite of studying hard, and experimenting with a variety of drug and holistic treatments, we knew that, although we could keep him comfortable, there had been no lasting improvement. Within the last week we began to notice some worrying changes in Eddie's voiding anatomy, and this morning the vet confirmed that there is a rectal mass which needs to be removed.\nIt is not all bad news. Because we have been observant, she thinks that they will be able to excise a good margin, and is hopeful that he will make a good recovery. From the shape of the mass we know that it is not the most serious cancer for that location. Of course, a lot will depend on the biopsy result, and also the state of a further patch of ulceration - which we know that he does have, higher up. Eddie was such a good boy for his examination, he trembled, but remained stoic. Unfortunately he is now in starvation mode - which is far worse for a Beagle!\nI will post when I have news, forgive me if I'm a little less chatty for a while. Wish him luck.",

IBS, ulcers, H Pylori etc?\n\nThree main possible causes -\n\nBacterial\nFungal\nParasite/protozoal\n\nLots of speculation that UC is down to the MAP bacteria.\n\nYou could try attacking on all angles - that's actually what a lot of people do when they think something's up but can't pin-point it.\n\nHere is a list of commonly used anti-microbials - for human use. I don't know if they are safe for dogs so you would need to look into that.\n\nWormwood\nBlack Walnut Hulls\nCloves\n- Above three commonly used in a parasite cleanse - with psyllium husk taken half hour later)\n\nGarlic (not too much for dogs - it can be toxic)\nCoconut oil\nPau d' Arco\n- Commonly used for fungal infections)\n\nCinnamon\nCats claw\nTurmeric\nGarlic\nOlive leaf\nOregano oil\nMastic Gum (esp for H Pylori)\n- Bacterial, but also wide spectrum against some protozoa/fungi\n\nThen you have herbs, such as Thyme, Rosemary etc which also exert anti-microbial effects.\n\nI highly recommend the GAPS diet/book - just for general knowledge, and see what of that you might be able to apply to dogs.\n\nPS, yes antibiotics count too, although they can often lead to overgrowth of things if they are not properly targeted. Did he get some relief after Metronidazole? If so could indicate protozoa or bacteria such as H Pylori.\n\nYou may also want to look at Neem bark powder - a natural proton pump inhibitor (but will antimicrobial effect too) especially if his urine PH is more acidic that what is considered normal. Neem powder by itself has been shown to eradicate stomach and duodenal ulcers \n\nHope that helps.",

    "An quick update. We saw the vet at the beginning of March, and he was very casual about this. I asked if it was better to remove it while it was still small, but he said that to leave would not be a problem, as it would come away easily with a cauterising knife. It doesn't seem to be growing very quickly. Wait and see.", 
    "An update.\nLast month I noticed that brown tartar was starting to build up on the two teeth behind Merry's epulis. So, after speaking online to another Beagle owner, I somewhat nervously decided to lasso the neck of it with a loop of dental floss. The following day it looked pink, and the next, purple, before finally developing a blackish look. Merry didn't seem at all bothered, and once she had a decent sized dental chew, it disappeared - there was not even a mark!

    "The World Record organisers have posted that the Beagle count reached 920 today - and there is still another 8 months to go! Excitement levels are rising!", 
    "I am getting really excited about this - such a shame that not only do I not own a Beagle but I am half way [well nearly] across the world.  SNIFF", 
    "Well, we are now almost there, and the Beagle World Record Attempt is now only seven sleeps away.\nConfirmations this week are said to total 1270 families, (and their cars), and just under 1600 adult Beagles, who are travelling from all areas of the country. All will need to produce documentary proof of their breed before taking part. Puppies and non qualifying dogs will have their own unofficial walk after the main event. There will also be various stalls, and a companion dog show in the afternoon. \nIt is likely that there will be some TV coverage, but it may be on regional channels. We will try to take some photos, but I suspect the best ones will be taken from the air by a professional drone operator. I hope we don't create too much chaos on the A34. The event stands to raise a substantial amount of money for the two charities, Beagle Welfare and Unite to Care. I am truly in awe of the small team of organisers of this event, and hope they can get back to sleeping soundly next Sunday night!", 
    "How exciting. Hope all goes well and the weather is kind - to the humans. LOL.", 
    "Thank you @muddymoomoo. Rather a nice touch is that once a year Australian Beagle groups have a synchronised charity walk in various areas of their country. Although it will not count, I believe that this year they have moved the date of their walk to be able to show their support for our record attempt.", 
    "Hello,\n\nI am genuinely curious if Beagles need a fenced in yard or a leash at all times.  I have heard their nose predicts where they go.  My current dog has a wonderful recall and hasn't needed a leash for some time.  We do not have a fence.  We do have a sizable plot of land but part of it borders a busy road.  How is their recall or does this depend on the dog?  Thanks for any advice/input.  I have always been intrigued by these little hounds.", 
    "Hmm. The short answer is, it depends. Whenever a Beagle's nose is deeply onto a trail, he is likely to be deaf. They do not intend to be disobedient, it is just that their instinctive drives take precedence, so in controlled conditions, they can have a really good recall, but when the foxes are laying their trails, (which is at the moment in the UK), less so. There are always more Beagles reported as missing at this time of year, though the majority are not lost for long.\n\nBoth my Beags are rehomes. Eddie came at 17 weeks, and started obedience and working trial training straight away. He learned to track on both human and aniseed  scent, and has never shown more than a passing interest in wildlife. \nOn the other hand, Merry was almost six when she came here, and had previously lived in a pack environment. I have had her almost two years, and it breaks my heart that she can only be trusted off lead in a garden, or a sheep-fenced field. Once she has checked the boundaries, her recall is great, but she is far too rabbit, and dog, obsessed to ever be allowed to run free on open ground, even though she is the most loving dog in the world.", 
    "Thanks for the answer.  My uncle had Beagles when I was a kid and they were the friendliest little wiggle butts I ever did meet.  His dogs were of hunting stock.", 
    "A trainer acquaintance had two beagles who were successful in obedience (quite a few years ago). During one competition, she was working one of her dogs in the ring when he took it into his head to bolt. They found him three days later. Not a breed you can be complacent with. He'd never done it before, or since.", 
    "Yes @Chris B, I have a friend who is working Test A with her two, but even they have what I regard as scary lapses. Eddie will occasionally duck under a ring rope if he thinks he spots a stay tit bit, but he is too much of a mummy's boy, (ie. Wimp), to run away without being pursued by lions.\nTo be fair, Merry wouldn't go far, but she will only return at her own speed, and we are getting too old to clamber up hills after her. There is currently a lot of interest in the Tractive tracers for hounds, but there are too many roads and railway lines in this neck of the woods for us to feel comfortable taking chances. Far safer to hire a Dog Friendly Field.", 
    "It is great to note that two Beagles have been selected to compete in the Inter-Regional Team Obedience at Crufts this year, one for the Northern team, and one for Wales. Both hounds are filling the Beginner spots in their respective teams. Wishing Good Luck to both of them.", 
    "Having met a few Beagles at Obedience Classes, I know how much work those owners must have done to reach that standard.  Congratulations to them and I hope they do really well.",

I was stupid - only had to go half way up the ramp and would normally grab my crutches and not go on my chair but somehow thought the chair would look more effective.\n\nNearly strangling my baby in the process",

I do not use my chair indoors, or my crutches, since Nir fitted strong grab handles on all doorways, and I just swing from one to the other - it is easier.\n\nBut I could have strangled Tikva because she was so tight caught I could not even unclip her.\n\nSorry - gone way off topic.

For example, the latter two dogs had all equipment at floor level and basically walked through the course. \n\nThe older handler did the full course but worked hard on directional control so he'd work basically in the middle of the course directing from a distance.\n\nNothing is impossible with a bit of ingenuity and a trainer who works around their charges",

Though she is doing quite well at searching for articles, she has been a little slow to latch on to following a 1/20 aniseed trail. It is messy stuff to carry out to the fields, so yesterday I just laid her a S shaped trail round the bungalow and front garden. She was really excited when she saw the equipment come out, and she tracked it like a veteran, (which she is!). I'm really hoping the penny has dropped.

    "Hi,\n\r\nI'm new to Dogsy and am looking for some help and advice.\n\r\nAround 4 months ago I rehomed what I believed to be a beagle from a family that could no longer give him the time he needed (a common problem as I understand it).  They had purchased him from Dogs 4 Us in Manchester and he is DLRC registered.\n\r\nLet me just say that I would never buy a puppy from this company.  I understand that they mainly deal with puppy farms and having recently visited their new branch just down the road from me in Leeds my opinions on that are stronger than ever.\n\r\nBrian, my dog, is wonderful, I love him to pieces but he is not a beagle.  He is most certainly a Harrier, standing almost 21 inches at the withers and looking nothing like a beagle other than his tri-colour.\n\r\nI am uncertain what to do.  Obviously I will be contacting dogs 4 us about this as Harrier's are not even a KC recognised breed in the UK.  Does anyone have any advice for me?  In particular I am interested in the differences in health and temperament between Harriers and Beagles.  I wanted a beagle as our family pet and a companion for my four year old son.  Size was important as obviously four year olds are little lol.\n\r\nI have been unable to find any harrier breeders and believe that these dogs are pretty much exclusively used in hunt packs.  Hunt kennels are not allowed to sell their dogs so I worry how he has been bred and sold.\n\r\nThanks in advance for anyone that reads this,\r\nMooma and Brian the not beagle!", 
    "Gosh, I'm not sure what advice to give you.\n\r\nI should imagine that the fact that you got Brian '2nd hand' rather than direct from Dogs 4 Us will give you limited or no come back on them whatsoever.\n\r\nI must confess to never having heard of the harrier before, but on googling, found this:\n\nHistory\n\r\nHarriers are very fast hunting hounds. They possess an excellent nose, and they also have a lot of stamina. There are several contradictory stories about the origin of this breed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the Harrier you get today is somewhere in between the English foxhound and the Beagle in size. These dogs were mainly developed to hunt hare. \n\r\nCharacteristics\n\r\nHarriers are very good natured dogs, therefore making them a good choice to have as a family pet. These dogs are very warm and sweet, but they can be quite obstinate. It is advantageous to have some previous dog ownership experience before getting one of these dogs. Harriers are very well balanced, and they have lots of energy. It is important to provide these dogs with enough mental and physical stimulation in order to keep them occupied, otherwise they might engage in destructive behaviour. \n\r\nTemperament\n\r\nHarriers tend to be more playful and sociable than the Foxhound. These dogs are happy and kind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and they also get along wonderful with children. Harriers prefer to be in the company with their people or other dogs. These dogs also love to go off and explore and sniff. \n\r\nCare\n\r\nThese dogs do not have a lot of grooming requirements, and are therefore ideal dogs for people unable to commit a lot of time to their pets. Their coats should only be brushed on an occasional basis. It is advised that their ears should also be checked out to make sure that they are clean and dry. These dogs are fairly low shedders, and will be a good match for someone suffering from allergies. For more detailed info, take a look at the Harrier Dog Grooming page.\n\r\nTraining\n\r\nHarriers are good with children, and they tend to be also friendly with strangers. It is good to socialize them with other dogs from a young age onwards; otherwise they might chase smaller pets when they are older. Because of their stubborn nature, some of them do prove difficult to housebreak. They are however quick learners. In general, these dogs are friendly and affectionate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c therefore making wonderful companions for their families. \n\r\nUnfortunatley I don't think I'm allowed to post the link on Dogsey, but if you google, you should find the info.\n\r\nIf the above description is to be believed, it doesn't sound like you have anything to worry about in terms of temperament and relationship with children; so Brian may be bigger than a beagle, but it doesn't sound like he will grow to the size of a foxhound.  I'm sure with a bit of care on your side, his size will not be a problem.\n\r\nAll in all, if Brian is wonderful, personally I would put this down to experience and just enjoy him.",

Yes he's stubborn and training him has been a nightmare (especially as the previous family hadn't done any!!) but he's getting there and he hasn't demolished anything for alomst a week!!  I'm pretty sure he's stopped growing too (he's ten months), which is good!\n\r\nI think the thing that has got me so cross is that the original sellers had missold him.  He is so much quicker than a beagle and even less responsive to recall (though he's doing well with that too now).  Had I not been as stubborn as he is he'd been running rings round us.

    "I have to admit i agree with Dawn. But i also don't really understand the problem. Even if he is a Harrier they are basically just a slightly bigger beagle so i don't see any problems if you were wanting to have a beagle.

I originally thought that he was probably just a poorly bred beagle and it wasn't until I saw him with a couple of beagles that I began to wonder if he was a beagle at all.

I could happily give it a few inches either way but he's 21 inches to the withers, a whole five inches taller than the ideal tallest beagle.\n\r\nMaybe it's just me feeling a little bruised that he's not picture perfect and trying to fit him in another category.

I think we get too tied up sometimes in what the \"perfect\" dog is as in, is he the right height, is his nose the right shape etc. The perfect dog is simply the dog that is perfect for you.

    "American Water Spaniel", 
    "Just thought I'd pop something on here about these lovely little dogs. Have yet to meet one, but as the Kennel Club recognised them as a breed on the import register from July hopefully I'll meet one very soon! \n\nAmerican Water Spaniel Breed Standard\nGundog Group\n\nGeneral Appearance\nThe American Water Spaniel was developed in the United States as an all-around hunting dog, bred to retrieve from skiff or canoes and work ground with relative ease. The American Water Spaniel is an active muscular dog, medium in size with a marcel to curly coat. Emphasis is placed on proper size and a symmetrical relationship of parts, texture of coat and color. \n\nSize, Proportion, Substance \n\n\n15 to 18 inches for either sex. Males weighing 30-45 lbs. Females weighing 25-40 lbs. Females tend to be slightly smaller than the males. There is no preference for size within the given range of either sex providing correct proportion, good substance and balance is maintained. Proportion--is slightly longer than tall, not too square or compact. However, exact proportion is not as important as the dog being well-balanced and sound, capable of performing the breed's intended function. Substance --a solidly built and well-muscled dog full of strength and quality. The breed has as much substance and bone as necessary to carry the muscular structure but not so much as to appear clumsy. \n\nHead\nThe head must be in proportion to the overall dog. Moderate in length. Expression is alert, self-confident, attractive and intelligent. Medium size eyes set well apart, while slightly rounded, should not appear protruding or bulging. Lids tight, not drooping. Eye color can range from a light yellowish brown to brown, hazel or of dark tone to harmonize with coat. Disqualify yellow eyes. Yellow eyes are a bright color like that of lemon, not to be confused with the light yellowish brown. Ears set slightly above the eye line but not too high on the head, lobular, long and wide with leather extending to nose. \nSkull rather broad and full, stop moderately defined, but not too pronounced. Muzzle moderate in length, square with good depth. No inclination to snipiness, The lips are clean and tight without excess skin or flews. Nose dark in color, black or dark brown. The nose sufficiently wide and with well-developed nostrils to insure good scenting power. Bite either scissor or level. \n\nNeck, Topline, Body\nNeck round and of medium length, strong and muscular, free of throatiness, set to carry head with dignity, but arch not accentuated. Topline level or slight, straight slope from withers. Body well-developed, sturdily constructed but not too compactly coupled. Well-developed brisket extending to elbow neither too broad nor too narrow. The ribs well-sprung, but not so well-sprung that they interfere with the movement of the front assembly. The loins strong, but not having a tucked-up look. Tail is moderate in length, curved in a rocker fashion, can be carried either slightly below or above the level of the back. The tail is tapered, lively and covered with hair with moderate feathering. \n\nForequarters\nShoulders sloping, clean and muscular. Legs medium in length, straight and well-boned but not so short as to handicap for field work or so heavy as to appear clumsy. Pasterns strong with no suggestion of weakness. Toes closely grouped, webbed and well-padded. Size of feet to harmonize with size of dog. Front dewclaws are permissible. \n\nHindquarters\nWell-developed hips and thighs with the whole rear assembly showing strength and drive. The hock joint slightly rounded, should not be small and sharp in contour, moderately angulated. Legs from hock joint to foot pad moderate in length, strong and straight with good bone structure. Hocks parallel. \n\nCoat\nCoat can range from marcel (uniform waves) to closely curled. The amount of waves or curls can vary from one area to another on the dog. It is important to have undercoat to provide sufficient density to be of protection against weather, water or punishing cover, yet not too coarse or too soft. The throat, neck and rear of the dog well-covered with hair. The ear well-covered with hair on both sides with ear canal evident upon inspection. Forehead covered with short smooth hair and without topknot. Tail covered with hair to tip with moderate feathering. Legs have moderate feathering with waves or curls to harmonize with coat of dog. Coat may be trimmed to present a wellgroomed appearance; the ears may be shaved; but neither is required. \n\nColor\nColor either solid liver, brown or dark chocolate. A little white on toes and chest permissible. \n\nGait\nThe American Water Spaniel moves with well-balanced reach and drive. Watching a dog move toward one, there should be no signs of elbows being out. Upon viewing the dog from the rear, one should get the impression that the hind legs, which should be well-muscled and not cowhocked, move as nearly parallel as possible, with hocks doing their full share of work and flexing well, thus giving the appearance of power and strength. \n\nTemperament\nDemeanor indicates intelligence, eagerness to please and friendly. Great energy and eagerness for the hunt yet controllable in the field. \n\nDisqualification\nYellow eyes.\n\nHere are some pics:"

    "My friend may be getting one of these soon. I tried to look them up but there isn't much information on them and rather than look like an idiot can anyone fill me in quick?", 
    "I hope your friend likes a very busy life!!!!\r\nLovely dogs if you keep them entertained - very very high energy needs, can be very noisy and destructive - come in a massive variety of colours  attractive dogs \r\nI love sled dogs but I couldn't live with a CED!!!!", 
    "The history of the Canadian Eskimo Dog in the UK is a bit confused as until fairly recently they were lumped in with Greenland Dogs as one breed - The Eskimo Dog. The KC separated the two and they are now recognised as similar but separate breeds. \n\r\nThe issues of keeping Siberian Huskies are well known - high prey drive, no-off lead etc - with Canadian Eskimos you can multiply these problems a few times. Not an easy dog to live with unless you are really well prepared and ready to cope with anything....... This is from a CED website: ..\n\n\nCanadian Eskimo Dog\r\nThe Canadian Eskimo Dog is the dog used by the Inuit as an all-purpose haulage dog and is smaller than the heavyweight Alaskan Malamute but not as light as the quick Sled Dog, the Siberian Husky.  It is thought they arrived in Canada from Greenland approximately 1,000 years ago.  The Eskimo dog was crucial to the survival of the Inuit; they were used as sledge dogs and helped with hunting by locating seal breathing holes and were sufficiently courageous to hold polar bears at bay.  \n\r\nIt was the Eskimo Dog that proved itself on Polar expeditions; on one trip a six dog team hauled a fully laden sled 750 miles in two weeks.  There is a considerable variance in size between dogs and bitches - dogs at up to 68cm and 105lbs can weigh half as much again as the bitches.  He has a dense double coat offering weather protection and excellent insulation; the undercoat is exceptionally thick with the coarse outer coat longest on the neck and shoulders with distinct breeches and a plumed tail.  All colours and combinations are acceptable.\n\r\nThey were never domesticated whilst working as sledge dogs and were partly self-sufficient, being encouraged to hunt their own prey.  These instincts to kill remain so they must be treated with great caution around livestock and other pets. Secure fencing is essential. They are good-natured and affectionate but distinctly independent, as would be expected from a breed who was accustomed to fending for himself.  Early socialisation is essential as they are wary by nature.\n\r\nThey are not trainable in the usual way, and for those who choose to welcome one into their home immense patience is vital; they are also extremely energetic and will take all the exercise that is offered.  As pack dogs they have a real need for company, whether human or canine.\n\r\nNot the easiest of breeds, the Eskimo Dog will not suit everyone and thorough research should be undertaken before taking one on.\n\r\nHope that's of some use\n\r\nMick", 
    "Mick,\n\r\nThat's a helpful post. I do admire these dogs (and have a painting of Greenland Dogs working in Scorsby Sound, Greenland in the sitting room...the artist regularly spends time in Greenland studying wildlife). However, from what i understand they would be very tricky to train as you mentioned and do have the extreme prey drive - making life with neighbours cats and small dogs a little tricky, I would imagine. \n\r\nDo you think it may be possible to work them in a rig or with a scooter as sibes and mals are, to give them a working outlet?\n\r\nMary",

    "The CED and the greenlands are very similar. One of the differences between the breeds are that (afriend of mine in canada described the CED up to the Grl dog - she has both) the CED is a tougher dog, harder tempered, and a bit heavier. They move a bit differently when working. But all in all its much the same.\r\nOver the years I've experienced greenlands of different lines and types. And one thing is clear - there are greenlands aswell who can be closely describes as a CED in temper, and also in buildt. The relations between the breeds origins from the west coast of greenland. Where the grld dogs are heavier and more furry, bigger. And then there is a type from east greenland who are lighter buildt. Both types has adapted to its climate over the centuries since there are rockier and more to the coastline in the east.\n\r\nI have a male myself imported directly from Sisimiut in west greenland, and his height is 69 cm and weighs about 40 kg. 3 others of my dogs are 50 % import from Illulissat(west) and Sisimiut. And one of the females is about 66 cm in height and weighs about 36 kg. and so on.\r\nThey have a minimum 5 cm lairs of coat and otherwise has the same type of coat as the CED.\r\nBUT these are dogs of mild temper, easy to handle if you are familiar with polar breeds, but they definately need a firm hand! \r\nShortly about the greenland opposed to the Ced:=)\r\nWorkwise they have the same needs as the CED, but have the ability to slow down and sleep through the whole summetime, and demand little excercise then. Only sm\u00e5ll walk or activity.\r\nThe greenland can as the CED become very destructive if  not stimulated enough workwise. But there are great individual differences ther aswell as in any other ways.", 
    "I'm a spitz person and I would be hard put to sort one from the other. Have not gone through the standard word for word but from the ring side I would find it difficult to separate them.\n\r\nFor those who are very interested or have time to spare the standard of both breeds will be on the KC web site. As a starter the CED is supposed to be an 1\" larger, not a lot of good as it is not likely that they or the Greenland are bred to standard.",

She is therefore not allowed off-lead unless we go to a quiet field near Norwich prison where I can see other dogs approaching.\n\r\nSimilarities with my Cairns are that I have found them both highly trainable breeds-have done heelwork to music, agility and obedience with my Kerries. They have won an agility trophy, 2 obedience trophies and a heelwork-to-music award.\r\nThey are also both very affectionate breeds that bond with you very closely I think. And both very playful.\n\r\nDifferences-Kerries are more of a \"showy\" breed in the show ring than Cairns. I have lightly showed Parker in local dog shows and he has 4 best-in-shows (most recent one this year at the age of 8 and a half) and 2 reserve best-in-shows and about 120 rosettes. They also take a lot more grooming than Cairns which I hadn't appreciated until I got them! Those curly coats may not shed but take a lot of grooming and trimming to keep smart.\n\r\nAlso (an obvious one I know!) the size difference is quite a shock! I had only seen Kerries in books and thought they were about the size of a mini Schnauzer but they are much bigger! Came as a shock after being used to handling small dogs.\n\r\nThe other difference is that when I had my Cairns I used to be able to visit my friend's house who had about 4 cats and the dogs would just sit calmly and ignore the cats (after Rusty had a sniff of one and got batted on the nose!). The thought of taking my Kerries into a house with 1 cat brings me out into a cold sweat let alone 4! It would be pandomonium.\n\r\nI would love another Cairn sometime in the future-perhaps if Cherry goes first we would get one as a companion for Parker (he is a year younger).

    "Hello everyone. this is my first post! \r\nI stumbled upon this forum whilst trying to research particular dog breeds. \r\nSo I'm living in Australia and have been reading every bit of info I can over the last month online. I have been researching partiularly the West Highland Terrier and Cairn Terriers. I figure, who better to ask than actual owners of these breeds. I am not looking to purchase until closer to the end of the year, though the sooner we can decide on a breed, the sooner we can research breeders and be prepared for our arrival. I have some renovating to do and figure best to get this out of the way first. I live in an apartment with my partner and we absolutely adore these two breeds, and we will get one or the other! We are aware of the time and care we will need to put in, especially living in a unit. We have access to wonderful dog parks and beaches in our area. We are ready for this responsibilty. The thing is, we can't decide which breed to pick! They both have lovely and exciting characteristics and are equally as gorgeous and probably naughty  \r\nAnother point to make is children will probably be on our agenda (maybe!) in about 3-4 years so our beloved pet will need to eventually be ok with a small child.\r\nI'm not sure if I have given you enough details, let me know! I will appreciate all positive and negative feedback. \r\nThank you", 
    "I've always had Cairns so naturally biased toward them. I have two at the moment who are beautiful dogs. I think both Cairns and Westies have similar charactaristics...being terriers you will have to train them well, as they can be headstrong, but once they realise that you are 'top dog' they should be a joy to own....they only need a moderate amount of exercise. I take mine out for a 40 minute walk twice a day, plus they have the freedom of my large garden.....Westies do moult, so be prepared for white hairs all over your furniture and carpets if you choose to go for that breed...I've never owned a Cairn that's moulted, which can be a bonus....A Cairns coat should be stripped rather than clipped for the best results, but a Westies need only be clipped.\r\nI would suggest, as with any breed, that you try and get as much information about the family history of the puppy before buying...you want a puppy that's not too bold but definitely not one that's too timid.\r\nBoth breeds should be okay with children as long as the dogs are taught that children are higher up the pecking order in the family than they are.\r\nGood luck .", 
    "I've got a cairn to so im biased towards them also. Westies and Cairns are obviously related so very alike with thier terrier characteristics, i know that westies can suffer from skin allergies and i would be careful especially if you live in australia with the warm sun. I agree with ticketyboo about getting information about the puppy and family before buying and research reputable breeders. I wouldn't worry about cairns and children as one of my books say they have a built in kid gene and love them but obviously dont let the dog get too over boisterous or the children annoy the dog, if they are socialised well when they are young with other dogs and kids it shouldn't be a problem. Whatever you choose good luck!\r\nif you need anymore info about cairns from my experience i will try my best to help.",

    "Oh my gosh, he's sooooo gorgeous!  A real cutie!",

    "This is my eldest cairn Bridie who's six years old\n\n\r\n...and this is my little girl Misha who's eighteen months old", 
    "Hello Kozziosko,\n\r\nAs others have said already, I think Westies and Cairns share a lot of similar characteristics. They can both be very strong-willed so clear, consistent training from the onset is neccessary to acheive a steady adult dog who can cope with anything life throws at them.  Good socialistion with other dogs and people, especially young children as you say you plan to start a family in a few years, is a must, along with introducing the puppy to different environmental factors such as car, busses, supermarkets, town centres etc if you want a well-balanced, content dog. Neither breed will tolerate tormenting children, I know my Westie wouldn't, so it's important that the dogs learn how to behave around children and vice-versa from a very young age, preferrably the very beginning. They are terriers, afterall, and this should always be remembered. \n\r\nWesties don't shed a lot if hair. However, you will find a few hairs about but not that much. They should ideally be handstripped and look better for it, however, they can be clipped, same goes with Cairns. Westies are prone to skin allergies so a hypoallergenic diet is probably best at the start. \n\r\nResearch your breeders carefully, and attend breed shows or shows where there will be Westies/Cairns there and ask the owners/breeders/handlers any questions you may have. \n\r\nBoth breeds are clever and do well at both agility and obedience if given the chance. I have trained my Westie to do agility, she can be very stubborn and willful at times but is a joy to own!  She has no health problems or skin complaints. I'm very careful with regards to what she eats and her grooming, so this helps, but she is a hardy wee soul.\n\r\nHere are a selection of photos of Molly:", 
    "thanks again for your pics, they are so sweet!  You guys aren't making this easy for me! hahaha.  Just kidding, it's all very helpful.  I am going to start locating breeders and breed shows, thank you!", 
    "Howdy peeps!\r\nJust an update, we have decided to go with the Westie. It's what's in our hearts and I'm glad we finally made a decision!  It was a very difficult one though.  Thank you all for your advice and showing me your pics  \r\nI have heard from a fantastic breeder in my state, I am likely to put my name on their waiting list.  \r\n~Koren",

    "Hi everyone! I'm back again with poo issues with Mila!  ever since her diarrhea episode last month I only feed her just her plain old dry dog food (its Pedigree dry dog food). Now this time shes been having dry crumbly poo & shes straining & yelping sometimes. This has been happening now close to a week I would say. She does poo every day. Sometimes 2x in a day. She eats her dog food normally. I only give her 1 small cup at a time cuz she whoofs down her food then laps up a bunch of water then is burping for the next hour. So giving her small amounts of food did help that a little. \nAfter reading on PetMD of course I read the horrible causes of her constipation issue. Could it be a simple thing like her dog food isn't giving her what she needs? Not enough fiber? She does get good exercise. We go on our morning walks. What could this be now? Due to finances I haven't made a vet appt yet. My husband has health issues & the bills for that are horrendous!I'm hoping in April to get her to my vet & examine Mila. So in the meantime should I change her diet up a bit? Change the dog food to something with more fiber? TIA!",

    "Hi everyone! I have a 9 year old Mal. She recently developed a sensitivity to her dog food. She was eating the Nutro chicken and sweet potato healthy weight for large breed. She' s eaten the Nutro/Natural Choice line of food her whole life and it was always good for her.\n\nSo now we're looking for a limited ingredient, senior, sensitive stomach, large breed dog food.

    "Hello,\nI recently acquired a Alaskan Malamute to train as a service dog.  I was told that  he was found in a dumpster at about 2  weeks old.  He was adopted by a young woman who wanted to train him to be a diabetic alert dog for her mother.  She started his training to be a service dog, but than her mom passed.  She wanted him to be adopted by someone needing a service dog. He had already completed his basic obedience training and had just begun training as an assistance dog.  I adopted him and sent him to be trained as a service dog.  I was very fortunate as I found an excellent trainer near where I live and as a bonus the cost of training him as a mobility service dog was lower than most other trainers I have researched on the internet.  It was a large facility with 4 trainers and the owner who is a well respected dog trainer. He was trained and past his test a couple weeks ago.  Once a week, I went to the training center to work with him.  Actually, he was easier to train than I was.  In San Diego County they issue assistant dog tags with proof of training, documentation of his vet care and doctors note.  \nKoni is very beautiful.  He is stubborn like most malumates I am told. He is a perfect service dog when working but when he is off duty he loves to play and run.  He gets on great with our other dogs, our cat, our parrott and the rest of the family.  \nI have researched malumates on the internet.\nI am a retired nursing instructor.  I am also an attorney and do pro bono work with foster children and children who are under the supervision of the family court and social services,  I have not been able to do much pro bono work recently because I have arthritis and back problems due to arthritis. I have back pain most of the time if I am not laying down and I have weakness in my left leg.  Koni provides balance support, counter balance, he helps me up and down steps and  he provides bracing.  I have four boys. Two are police officers, one is an attorney and our fourth is in high school who we adopted after he was placed with us at 5 weeks as a medical fragile infant.  I just became 70 years old and believe me it is hard raising a teenager at our age. I have a great husband who helps with Koni.  \nBeadel",

    "Hard to say how much Philippa, but you are not feeding to appetite, the idea is a gradual reintroduction for the digestion. If it was a Beagle, around 12 - 20 kg, I would do a single human sized quantity - I measure the rice by volume, so about 150ml. As Malka said, cook in rather more water than you would do normally, and add a little salt. The grains should be a little sticky/crumbly when cooked. Allow to cool.\nFor the first meal, I would probably only give a rounded tablespoonful, with a similar quantity of shredded poached chicken breast, or white fish.

Both baby and big dog wipes will help keep the anus clean.  Just do not try to wipe/clean with loo paper or paper towels as they will be too rough.

There really should be no need to have to use corrections. \nIf pup is getting to wound up or you just need a break pop him in a time-out. A room separate from you for just a few short minutes. Not only does this teach him that his behaviour results in no attention/fun it also teaches him the valuable lessons of alone time. A place he will come to learn is where he has to have his down time. \nDistraction works for 9 out of 10 problems. Pup getting into something it shouldn't, nipping, general behaviour you don't want to encourage - distract before the pup gets the opportunity to practice naughty behaviours. \nTrading works for any resource guarding behaviours that pop up. Pup has something he shouldn't/ Offer him something better. \nPlay can also deter pup from naughty behaviours and release that on a toy and good game with you. Great bonding too. \n\nIn regards to his kennel and the guardy behaviour that area really should be his & his alone with no access or disturbance from your other adult dogs. When pup is in his crate pop your other dogs in their 'chill out' area or keep them away from the pup at the very least. \n\nAll the above are things I've found very helpful in training/managing my own puppies but they're certainly not instant successes you really need to be consistent.

    "Hey everyone!\n3 days ago I got a beautiful 6 week old Alaskan Malamute named Piper. She is a big ball of energy and the sweetest best friend I could have.\nI do have a few questions/concerns and would love to hear from people more experienced than I am!\nFirst of all, this is my first mal and I researched the breed extensively before making the decision to get Piper. But I am still super nervous about making sure I give her a happy life! I felt totally prepared before I got her and then my first night I was like \"ohhh man. I don't know what I'm doing\"\n\n1) I know she is super young and could have used a couple more weeks before her forever home. However, the other pup was gone and her momma was not super interested. I'm sure this is going to give me some new challenges and was wondering if anyone else has had experience with a younger pup?\n2) I'm trying to find ways to tire her out since she won't have her second round of shots until Feb. 5th so that limits the things we can do outside of the house.\n3) How long did it take for your mal to get used to crate training?\n4) The first night I had her I discovered she had worms. Really really bad round worms. She was throwing up piles of them and pooping out even more. It was pretty horrific. I got her treated first thing in the morning and shes much better now thankfully. Is it normal for this to happen? I've had a lab who got worms once out of the blue, but I'm not used to seeing it on such a small pup.\n5) Potty training has been pretty hard. I'm attempting to train her to use the bell but it's not sticking at all. Any tips?\n6) She is a FARTING MACHINE. Oh man. It's constant and smells so bad. lol You can also hear it. Totally sounds like a people fart which is hilarious. Could I be concerned that she is so gassy? Could this be from the deworming and vaccs?\n\nI know it's only been 3 days and she is super young, but I want to make sure I do the right things!\nThanks everyone!! Can't wait to be a part of this group!", 
    "Hi there & welcome! I too have a Mal  Mila is 1yr old & is a great dog I have 4 kids so she is always doing something here! I didn't have her when she was a wee pup...I bought her 2mos ago. My advice is handle ur pup as often as u can. Touch her paws, ears...everything! Get her used to being handled. The young girl I bought Mila off of never did that & it made it extremely difficult to brush Mila at first & clip her nails. After ALOT of work tho shes come full circle!  Mila hated being brushed & hates her paws being touched. But shes ok now after working with her  I bought a harness for pulling so since we got tons of snow here in western PA Mila pulls the kids around in the sled! she loves it! \nI'm assuming ur pup has gas due to the worm medicine? Again I'm no expert on that but I'm sure someone on here will be happy to answer those questions  this is a very helpful site! puppies tend to wear out quickly so just simply playing with her with her toys & running around when shes outside will wear her out quickly! Mila poops out after a good run around outside. Lol  she really loves getting her baths tho...thankfully! I like to give her a bath once a week sometimes every other week. Keeps her smelling good & her coat looking good too! thats about all I gotta say for owning a Mal. It maybe tough now cuz ur Mal is so little but hang in there! It wont last forever!  just like with my kids,  the newborn stage was tough (getting up every 1-2 hrs at night  lol) but now I miss that stage! lol. They grow fast!  enjoy ur new Mal!",

    "1) I dont have any experience in this area beyond knowing that good practice suggests separating a fair bit older but given you have her now, i can only assume that she will require whatever a mother would have traditionally given, warmth, comfort, opportunity to explore a safe and small environment, security and affection. beyond that i wouldnt be to fussed about anything else. \n2) mistake i made with our new pup was assuming they need some vigorous running about to tire them out,  when in reality, and what was much more productie was to be told \"nope, nap time\" and allowing for tons of sleep, then 4 hours more than i thought. with tiny 20 min gentle exercises and play between. No leashed walks at all. \n3) Ours took to it fairly well, over a period of days we left treats etc in the cage, under blankets etc, rewarded any sign she might enter, double rewards for going inside, plenty praise, never punishment, put an old jumper/and a breeder supplied old worn blanket from her pen in there for scent. just made it a wee safe haven and didnt capitulate at all on any fuss to get out. any time we had to put her in was done matter of fact, no fuss, no fight either, its just a place she goes for a spell.\n4) No ideas here, seek proper treatment and advice from a Vet. Promptly, and continue as needed. \n5) personally, and i am theorising a bit i would absolutely dispense with potty training at all for at least the next 2 weeks, if you had got her \"at the appropriate time\" of 8+ weeks she would have had no training of any sort other than from her litter and mother on what to do, trying to train her at this point i would guess would be futile at best and harmful at worst. \n6) Again, no idea, probably/possibly due to all the changes. \n\nOverall, my advice would be think about what she would get from a good mother at this point, (she wouldnt be with a new owner if things had played out well) and give her that, once she is 8-10 weeks i would start having expectations. \n\nEarly lessons from Everest:\n\nPromote Sleep, lots of it, and then add more. \nShort PLAY sessions, mental stimulation, tons of treats (her food allowance spread out worked well for us), \nDont try and physically tire her out, wont work, shell get like a hyper child and the only solution is appropriate sleep. \nConsistancy is king, dont try something new when you think the last thing isnt working unless you have tried it for a minimum of 3-4 days.\nAsk lots of questions on here. its a great resource.\nHave in mind now, what you would like 80 lb of furry muscle and sharpness to do in 18 months, if you dont want bouncing and play biting, dont promote it now and try and extinguish later. \nPromote more sleep\n\nThey are a great breed to own, and will have you questioning what you expected but it all makes sense in the end,",

    "Hello everyone! Have a question here! This is my first experience in owning an unspayed female pooch so I'm wondering what to expect? I realize...just like the human ladies..that every girl dog is different. I've been noticing a pee smell on my rug that is by the back door (where I take her out to do business). She lays there by the door at night but I smelled a strong pee smell only on the 2 end corners of the rug. I have hardwood floors so I would know if she was just randomly peeing thru out the house. Since the poo accidents earlier this last week she hasn't had any more accidents (thankfully!). So my question is, could she be marking her scent to lead male dogs on the rug? This would be her first heat so Idk what to expect here!  lol. I know I found out with my female cat when she went into heat she peed EVERYWHERE in the house so we took care if that immediately! So are female dogs like that too? I have a neighbor that just lets her dog roam the county & hes a male. Assuming hes not fixed. Hes been coming over to my property alot lately it seems. I ALWAYS keep her on a leash too when outside. I don't trust her not to take off \nTIA!",

And only being able to go out of the front on her tether, with all the loose/stray dogs was frightening as her vulva was so swollen and leaking, she had no idea about keeping herself clean.\n\nBut in between once she had stopped bleeding and the three months later when Ram would spay her, seemed like a it had all been a nightmare.  \n\nThey are all so different though.

When a female comes into heat it includes bleeding and many people use diapers or boy underwear with sanitary pads.

    "I think Malka (Juli) is quite right that raw fed dogs might cope better with bones. The BARF followers tend to feed meat, (flesh), alone for the first week that they make the change, which lowers the pH level in the dogs stomach, enabling them to digest the regular amounts of bone that they will process in their raw diet.", 
    "Hello all!  well even tho its still cold & wintery here in PA (U.S.) it seems as tho Mila is slightly shedding a bit. I brush her every day with a slicker brush & I've been getting huge clumps off that brush! so from what I had read online about shedding Malamutes the Furbuster ( I may have the name wrong!) is not good for their coats? A rake is best for a double coated breed. I would love to hear what everyone does & what tools they use for the shedding season!  The dos & don'ts! Lol  TIA!",

    "Luckily [?] I have never had a long-coated dog although my rough Griffons had to be hand-stripped regularly, although that was for breed standard, not because of shedding.  \n\nI did buy a Furminator for Lexi as although she was rather fluffy and not too long coated as such, she shed like mad, although she loved being brushed every day which did help.  Pereg also shed a lot but being short coated it did not seem so bad .  Until the vacuum cleaner objected!  The Furminator was useless for her but a shedding blade was ideal for when she blew her coat - as long as I sat outside with her away from the direction of the wind!\n\nThe little horror Tikva, being a Doxie/Minpin cross does not seem to shed at all.", 
    "My goodness I just brushed Mila now & already i have 3 piles of fur!  lol shes a furry beast! my vacuum certainly is getting a workout! So I should go with a rake then for her under coat? Not a Furminator? I give her a bath weekly (which I just did yesterday) & that helps too. I didn't think she would start shedding this soon cuz its still winter here. The house temp usually is between 65-72\u00b0. Does that play a part in her early shedding or is this typically when Malamutes start to shed?", 
    "Oh my - Mila is definitely  a furry little booger!  How about trying a shedding blade?  I found them much better when Pereg was throwing her coat.", 
    "Why do you bath her weekly?\n\nI start off with a Pin Brush to loosen the coat then I use a double sided metal comb, wide tooth and then narrow tooth, its surprising the amount of hair that comes out, next for the longer surface hair I use a rubber horse curry comb, and then finish off with slicker brush.",

Let her walk in front of you say Haw! And turn her leash left. Then tell her to straighten out( makes the line go straight and tight) and move her back to the middle. Just tell her good girl dont do treats. If you out treats in the will expect it on the trail. Then tell her Gee! To turn right walk for maybe a minute and do it again Haw! Left pull your leash left then Straighten out! Go start on a tight line as your walking then Gee! To turn right. Do it for about six times during training. Then when you take her out to go potty on the leash use the same commands to tell her where you want to go. Once you get the basics let me know and we can move it up to advanced. It shouldn't take very long all of huskies are taught at a very young age the mushing commands and how to do them. Do consistently for a month before hooking her up to Anything. I train mine on a leash and a horse lunge line that's 30ft and then 50ft lunge line. So I know they know it.

    "Hi there, \n\nA bit of back story first:\n\nI've been with my partner for about a year and he has an 11 year old Malamute bitch named Siku. \n\nShe was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer in November 2016 and was given 3-6 months to live. Thankfully, she survived and there are no longer any signs of cancer.\n\nIn December 2017 she was showing signs of a phantom pregnancy, which we thought was very cute (at first) as she was mothering a teddy toy,  but it turned out to be Pyometra.  \n\nShe had the surgery and recovered perfectly.\n\nSince her recovery,  she has been 110% more vocal (she never used to howl & sing unless the smoke alarm went off when we burnt some toast) but now she howls ALOT (I actually don't mind it, its a wonderful sound). She is also alot more playful, which I didn't think was possible as even at 11 she is like a puppy.\n\nIs this kind of behavioural change normal?", 
    "Seems like I've been posting here quite a bit lately! Everyone is very helpful on here!  Any advice on trimming doggy nails? I bought a nice nail trimmer (Dremel kind) & today hubs & I attempted to trim Mila's nails...epic fail! we put her muzzle on & she just refuses to be still & let us do her nails. Its super quiet & doesn't vibrate hard. Shes a big baby tho when it comes down to it! lol. What can I do to help her be still & comfortable with us doing her nails? TIA!", 
    "Some dogs do not like the Dremel. All you can do is just do a little on one nail, and reward for letting you do that much. It can take a while for them to accept having a full nail grind. My boy doesn't mind whether he is Dremelled or clipped, but my girl will not tolerate the Dremel at all. \nThe best method I have found is to use a Resco a guilottine nail clipper, and to do a triangular cut to be sure that I don't catch the quick. There is a good video illustrating this method by Kikopup on YouTube. Google, Kikopup nail trimming.",

It worked for me brushing her. She now lets me brush her without a treat (but i still give her 1 anyways!).  She absolutely hates her paws being messed with. She'll growl & try to bite us. Her quicks r pretty long & we don't feel comfortable with using the guillotine clippers. So we'll have to Dremel them down til the quick shortens. Its just gonna take time but we'll work it thru!", 
    "There is absolutely no way I could trim Tikva's nails even though I have a proper guillotine nail clipper, plus a different kind, and a dremel.  She is such a wriggler and so unbelievably strong for a small dog, but as Ram comes here every three months for her Parkworm shot [and her yearly boosters] I let him do it!  Tikki adores him so does not object, also he is a very big and strong guy and she knows he is the boss!\n\nIt is only her front nails that need trimming though as she spends so much time outside on her hind legs so she can see everything that is going on, so her rear nails keep the perfect length - although Ram does check them when he checks her paws.\n\nGood luck with Mila's nail trimming Jessica!",

    "Mila is what, about a year old now?

    "Two comments which I have just received from people in the US who own Tervs:\n\n\"Cheyenne's upper gums are pink and black, more pink on right side, more black on left.  Lower gums are mostly black.\n\nOur first Belgian Sheepdog \"Player\" had pink upper gums with black patches.  He also had a black patch on the underside of his tongue.\n\nBreed descriptions often list things like color as mandatory or preferred.  I did a quick check online and didn't find anything really specific, except one reference that said gum and lips preferred color is dark.\"\n\nand\n\n\"It is a preference for BSD show dogs to have darker gums.  None of us have found anything or aware of anything linking lighter gums to an autoimmune disease.\"", 
    "I know that statement from US. I don't have any vitiligo-dogs myself, so I could show pics, but believe me, depigmentation of gums in breeds with strong pigment is not ok. When gums and lips start to turn pink, it is not something even vets take lightly in here. Also the attitude that good pigmentation is only for shows - no, same goes all to way to the breed standards. That is all for whole breed, not only for shows.\nafter collecting data of almost 40 000 BSD worldwide and also collected pics or even taken those myself, I can assure you that there is a very strong linkage especially with thyroid and vitiligo (and also gastritis and allergies) with pink gums.\nI edit this: visible ares of gums have to be pigmented. Very often under upper lip gums are more pink.",

    "Personally i would use the pool myself and have him in the area but ignore him and see if he jumps in of his own accord or atleast investigates the pool. I find Phoebe likes to do things in her own time and the more i encourage one way the more she pulls the other way. Once he's done it it wont be such a big deal. Ive also heard a ramp helps as they can walk in slowly instead of one huge leap that can be scary (or so the dog swimming lady tells me at our local hydrotherapy place)", 
    "I agree with Katygeorge.  We had a large pool when I lived in South Africa and my three dogs used to swim in every morning at 5.30 on the dot.  They used to leap in at the deep end but always climbed out by using the steps at the shallow end.  It's very important to supervise your dog whilst it's in the pool in case it gets into difficulties and can't get out which happened to my friend's corgi when he was in pool with my three.",

    "Hello, I\u2019m new to the forums. I was just wondering if anyone can help. This is Shiro. My brother got him from some guy who posted an add. The guy was giving away 3 free Puppies.

The guy who gave them away says that they are. Shiro is a couple months old. He has pretty short legs from what I\u2019ve seen online. Anyone know what he could be?

Here is a little about them.\n\nDelilah -- AB mix. 5-6 years old. Spayed, vaccinated and recently completed heartworm treatment. She loves people -- including my young children. She is a little reactive to reactive dogs...if they start something, she does not hesitate. Otherwise she does very well (currently resides with 7 dachshunds). Not good with cats. Very sweet and very lazy.\n\nSampson -- dachshund mix. 3-4 years old. Neutered, vaccinated and recently had his teeth polished. He loves people but is a little more reserved/timid. He looks to Delilah for the signal that people are okay -- if she shows him it is okay, and he warms up fast. He is a snuggle bug (would love to sleep with his new people). He loves toys (often can be found sleeping on a bed of plush squeaky toys). Fine with other dogs. Not good with cats. Very sweet. \n\nThis duo has definitely suffered abuse and neglect -- we are seeking a better life for them! Adoption fee is $150 but they come with a $250 food credit from Nature's Variety!

Blistery things.  Filled with fluid...always bleeding.  Vet took biopsy to rule out cancer.  They come and go daily on all toes.  They seem to be stumped at what is causing these.

    "Hello, Laurie. I would highly recommend purchasing Only Natural Pet Ultimate Daily Canine Vitamins Plus. You should also purchase some Only Natural Pet Brewer's Yeast & Garlic. Instead of antibiotics I would recommend using Only Natural Pet Eye & Upper Respiratory Homeopathic Remedy (contains herbs with antibiotic properties). As far as shampoo, I would recommend Only Natural Pet EasyDefense Herbal Shampoo & Conditioner. The shampoo doubles as flea prevention. I would recommend you stop using any chemical-based flea/tick prevention and use this shampoo and Only Natural Pet EasyDefense Herbal Spray. To heal the sores between his toes, I would recommend purchasing a product called CocoTherapy Organic Virgin Coconut Oil for Pets and applying twice per day directly to the sores. Only Natural Pet Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil is another great supplement to give. Only Natural Pet Pure Icelandic Salmon Oil is a bit more expensive, but better quality, so you can choose the one you can afford. Even better would be to purchase Only Natural Pet Salmon Oil Gelcaps. Only Natural Pet Skin & Itch Homeopathic Remedy is another supplement I recommend. I also very strongly recommend you purchase Only Natural Pet Skin Wellness. This is something I dealt with in my previous dogs, but not my current puppy (new puppy is not vaccinated, has never been given chemicals and will be kept intact) .",

From the best I can tell this poor fella has been in 6 homes. I know very little about this breed. We do have a 6 year old Old English Sheepdog. He needs some training for sure. So any advice is appreciated.\nThanks!Click to expand...\n\n2 years old is generally when AB's reach their maturity level and start to completely fill out. You will want to make sure to associate him with your other dog as much as possible now so as not to run into any long term problems. However much of his learned behavior as far as other dogs go is already learned. If he's been in 6homes it can mean that he's either very well socialized due to the large number of people he's been with or it could mean that he's had some behavioral issues and difficult to keep for some. So whatever the case may be be patient and give him lots of love. They are an awesome breed. I've had 3 american Bulldogs and have a 15 week puppy that I'm raising now. He's the best!!!",

They can seem stubborn but often we mistake intelligence for stubbornness. Treat him right and he'll love us forever. Send some pics!!!"

    "Hi there, we've had Miss Betty for six months now, she is the love of my life(!) we haven't had any health problems due to her breed as yet, but as with my other pooch she has health insurance. She has had a hairy cyst on her eye but that's a mutant cell that could happen with any breed and she is clear for the tests on juvenile cataract, etc. I would say go for it ASAP!  Betty is a clown who loves (LOVES!!!) to play and is so affectionate, she makes me laugh every single day without fail. No problems with her eating, in fact for being so small she is the greediest dog I know so I have to be mindful of what she has, although she runs around so much that it shouldn't  become a problem. You'll be aware if the snoring and snuffling? My goodness it can be so loud. I can hear her snoring at night even when she's downstairs and we are upstairs!\n\nI love my Betty Piggles and wouldn't hesitate in recommending them to anyone. One thing I would warn you about though...your walks will be twice as long as everyone will stop you to say hello to your Boston! :-D\n\nGood luck x", 
    "Anyone got one? Just want to know what they are like to own?", 
    "i dont own one personally but I have a close friend who has one, shes not typical of the breed and is larger than others I have met, but she has a delightful temperament, very laid back, never barks except at foxes, lives with 4 cats, guinea pigs and chickens with no problems...she has her crazy moments and is very playful. she will happily walk with any unknown humans...hence my friend has to be careful that she does not get stolen as she will get into cars and lay down with a blink of an eye...they have had her since she was 18mths old (she is neutered) and was re homed from a family who were going to live abroad and couldn't take her ( a middle eastern country I believe) . I have also met a male Boston who was totally different! about half the size of my friends.....totally different personality....very territorial and vocal! so I am not sure what the breed traits are! x I love them and their funny grunts and snuffle noises x we affectionately call her pigdog lol  x",

    "I only know of one member with a Boston ...\nI was in the proses of talking to breeders a few years ago before my situation changed ...\nThe ones i met where mini boxers in outlook...", 
    "ooo a Bosotn terrier thread ^^ \n\nIve had the breed for 8 years (before I moved to Xolo's) nd I honestly cant say a bad word about them... though I may be a tad biased! I showed for years and my am very proud of my show champion boy, but since hes getting on now I only help with the discover dogs stand occasionally. \n\nThey really are lovely dogs, and Ive only ever met one snappy one in all those years. \nThey are friendly, bouncy, active, playful and loving little dogs. They vary considerably in size and have three weight categories, lightweight, middleweight and heavyweight. Personally my boy is a heavyweight and my sisters bitch is a middleweight, but lightweight to middleweight are definitely more in vogue in the show scene and so are the more readily available types. Tuskar (my boy) is to the best of my knowledge still one of the largest in the uk though its been a while since i checked. \n Tuskar on the left, Sasha on the right. \n\nThey are the kind of dogs that are very active out and very snuggly indoors, Ive heard them compared to mini boxers but I dont think they are quite as 'manic'. There are a fair few people in the breed who moved from boxers to Bostons when they got older though. \n\nThey are relatively vocal and ive not yet met one that doesn't snore! Also, they are susceptible to juvenile cataracts and luxating patella. However there is thorough screening and testing going on to help eliminate these problems, and they are not as common as 'breed specific problems' would suggest they are. \n\nBostons are sociable dogs that get along very well with other dogs and children as a general rule, and as a side note, unlike frenchies, they can swim. (I thought it was strange the first time I was asked this on the discover dog stand by a lady trying to chose between the two breeds, but its worth noting that you dont have to worry about them 'capsizing!)\n\napologies if thats an information overload",

    "Hi there\n\nI've had my Betty Piggles for a few months now. She's quite a small Boston but she is mighty. Always the clown, her default setting is to play but she loves nothing more than a cuddle. She is so very affectionate and she makes me laugh every day without fail.\n\nIf you're still thinking about it you need to know that they snore......loudly! ( hence the name!) Very endearing but not if you let your dogs sleep in your bedroom. It's due to their little flat faces.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate in getting another Boston, everyone she meets fails under her spell & she certainly gives back all the love she receives\n\nJust a word if you're still looking, don't be tempted to pay more for a red Boston, some breeders may tell you that they are rarer but it's just a throwback in the genes. A proper breeder should not charge anymore at all. I found my breeder through the Kennel Club. Also make sure any puppy you get has been checked for hereditary juvenile cataracts \n\nGood luck (& without sounding tooooo bias)......go for it, you won't regret it!! ;-)\n\nMel xx",

    "bostons are nice little dogs. ive met quite a few at shows, and quite fancy one in the future (its a big dog next for me though!)\n\r\none thing i noticed with them, and the owners at discover dogs pointed out, they can be a bit fiesty and confrontational with other dogs because of what type of breeds are in their make up (the pitbull being one i think) and i saw this happen when a dog went up to greet them and they got a bit snappy and barky in their face.\n\r\nstill think they are great dogs though, i love their expression, and watch them alot at shows (always on the same day as us) as well as the pug the frenchie and the bulldog too  can you tell i like squishy faces",

    "Do they come in different size groups? \n\r\nI ask as I have seen some varience of size but they are definately Bostons the ones I have seen. \n\r\nThey definately seem ideal for me but sadly Ive been sanctioned by the job centre, I live with my parents and im still unemployed. The money which I would have saved for my next dog is currently what im living on so probably wont be able to afford a Boston puppy unless its a rescue and I get lucky.\n\r\nThough its still going to be a while before I get another dog as I paln to wait a year after I get a job so I can see how my routine will be which will give me time to save again!\n\r\nWhat kind of health tests do Bostons require?", 
    "They come in 'lightweight' 'middleweight' and 'heavyweight' My boy is a heavyweight and my sisters girl is a middleweight, lightweights however are in vogue in the show ring much more than the other sizes so are becoming more common. \n\nthey can suffer from luxating patella and juvenille cataracts but there is an extensive eyes screening programme which aims to eliminate this problem within the breed. Im not sure how to post pictures on here yet or id put one up of our two bostons together to illustrate the size difference.

    "I have had bostons my entire life, ever since I was a little girl! I love them,  the best breed IMHO! The thing about boston's (like all dogs) is you have to remember they will have their own temperments, which may vary. I've had male dogs that are tempermental, and VERY confident. I've had females that were the same, however my females seem to be more laid back, sweet, but very timid, and scared. All have been wonderful with children. They are small, with a short coat, that rarely sheds. In house dogs, they have energy and LOVE to play and run, and I encourage it, but watch them during the summer, they can, and will get too hot make sure they get plenty of water. During the winter they will get really cold so don't keep them outside to long. They have a tendency of having skin conditions which will cause them to scratch until sometimes they bleed, and cateratics (spelling may be wrong there). Here are my two I have now. The first is Buster, he is a red (or teal) Boston, and the second is Baby..it's hard to get a pic of her..lol.",

Loving, active, friendly, good with other dogs and people, and just plain adorable. \r\nTheyve got bucket loads of personality, my little boy Tuskar is a 'grumpy old man' who goes about his business and loves a cuddle. Hes not really grumpy... he got the title by having tunnel vision when it comes to me, if I call him he comes over for a cuddle, if my sister calls him (or most people for that matter) he will just turn his head away as if to say 'no... im sorry... but your not mum so your not good enough' XD he is nearly ten though bless him so hes entitled to be selective! He does love his cuddles though and is very loving.\r\nTen there is my sisters little girl who is nearly four, and she is the total opposite, she loves fuss from anyone (especially men!) and is very energetic. \n\r\nThere is nothing funnier than watching a boston terrier get all excited and bunch up with their ears back whilst tearing it around the garden... ill have to try and get a video of it one day and post it up!", 
    "Hey guys!\n\r\nSo I am really fascinated by bulldogs and terriers (though the less brachy ones admittedly) and during my research I came across this breed. Its only recognized by IOEBA and one other (the acronyms escape me, all those As and Cs and Ks!). \n\r\nSupposedly Charles McCaughin (first/main breeder of the current OBB I think) wanted boston bulldogs back to how they were pre-1930s, to bring back their functionality and health without the AKC's blessing. I have only found a handful of breeders who bred these dogs but wanted more information. \n\r\nSo since the search function failed me horribly here has anyone here encountered an OBB before? Can you guys give me anymore information? Is it true? Is it fiction? Should we start breeding back to when a dog's eyeballs were actually inside its skull?\n\r\nHere is a link to McCaughin's writings, vision and theory (he has since passed on): http://www.bostonetts.com/charlesmccaughin.htm\n\r\nAnd some breeders to check out the dogs: (I'm not sure if its alright to do this, I'm not associated with any of them and just wanted to give as much info as possible.)\n\nhttp://www.bostonetts.com/\nhttp://www.oklassic.com/\nhttp://www.freewebs.com/boston_bulldogges/\n\r\nD'awwww!

    "The English bulldog has conquered New Yorkers\u2019 hearts, with more wrinkly canines waddling the city streets than any other breed in 2013. But the breed\u2019s burst in popularity has a downside \u2013 nearly 350 were surrendered to city shelters last year.\n\nOn Tuesday night, bulldog lovers and celebrity pet owners, including Ice-T and his wife Coco, came together at the Long Island Bulldog Rescue\u2019s 15th-annual Bash for the bulldogs in New York City to raise awareness about abandoned English bulldogs, an issue first reported by the New York Post this week.\n\nThe star-studded event hosted by Beth Stern, animal advocate and wife of radio personality Howard Stern, raised funds for the New York charity to rescue and care for the dogs while they await adoption.\n\n\u201cWe need to raise money for these unbelievably expensive dogs, that are just being bred indiscriminately for profit, which you can\u2019t do with any breed, and this breed in particular,\u201d said Laurette Richin, executive director and founder of Long Island Bulldog Rescue (LIBR).\n\nA testament to the bulldog\u2019s rise, the breed has seen a 323% jump in registrations across the US since 2003, according to the American Kennel Club. \n\n\u201cWe credit their loveable personalities \u2013 the bulldog makes a great and loyal family pet and are also fantastic with kids,\u201d said Hillary Prim, an AKC spokeswoman.\n\nFacing growing demand for the chubby canines, pet retailers turn overseas or to puppy mills that often breed the animals in substandard conditions, which can exacerbate health problems or result in new ones.\n\n\u201cThese dogs don\u2019t have a lot of puppies,\u201d Richin said. \u201cThey\u2019re not a money-maker if you do it right, that\u2019s the problem. The demand far exceeds the supply. And today people are just anxious to get what they want when they want it.\u201d\n\nRichin said novice pet owners are soon finding they can\u2019t afford to care for the bulldogs. Though the dogs don\u2019t need much exercise and are good with children, they suffer from a range of health problems and can be difficult to train. Last year, her charity rescued 347 English bulldogs, up from 19 in 1999 when she founded the non-profit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing wonderful people who just didn\u2019t know, and they wind up, in some cases, having to mortgage their homes to take care of these health problems,\u201d Richin said.Click to expand...\n\nFull article and photograph here...\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/03/english-bulldogs-abandoned-ice-t-coco\n\nOnce again \"fashion\" ends up with unwanted dogs in rescue. \n\nSIGH",

The almost unanimous vote was friendly, easygoing and have a vet plus specialists on speed dial. Terrific dogs but expensive health issues.\n\nThen again we went with American Bulldog and while he doesn't have breathing problems or skin conditions, his knees are a mess.

This might not be all the possible diseases but some of the ones reported so they should be taken into consideration.\n\nAllergies\nThis can range from mild to severe. There are numerous different possible allergens grass types, straw, pollen, fleas, chemicals and cleaners. Some dogs are sensitive to shampoos. A dog can be allergic to multi things with more allergies developing over time. \nMinor allergies might cause some redness and itching. Severe allergies cause frequent itching & discomfort. This leads to biting and scratching. Causing raw skin, scabs and possible skin infection. Sometimes hives are present during a reaction. \n\nFood allergies can vary in symptoms they might cause hives and even itching but some symptoms are similar to that of other problems such as loose stool or diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss. Just as with other allergies food allergies can be progressive. If your dog is allergic to a couple of foods they could develop new allergies to other foods. \n\nAortic Stenosis\nThis can be serious or even fatal. Coughing, exercise intolerance  (passing out could follow too much exertion due to lack of oxygen), shortness of breath in normal activity and worse case scenario death. Surgery can be necessary, though it isn't always successful.\n\nBloat\nFrom what I've heard from those who have experienced it bloat is very scary. It primarily afflicts large breeds, especially those who are deep chested though it's possible to see it in other breeds too. It is a quick killer. Bloated stomach, vomiting, shortness of breath and pale gums are signs that you need to get your dog to the vet immediately. \nExercising after eating, over eating or eating excessively fast (gulping down food) can increase the risk for bloat. \n\nCanine Multi focal Retinopathy  (CMR1)\nThis disease causes lesions on the eye. Though they do not typically cause blindness and might even go away on their own. \n\nCherry eye\nThis is caused by prolapsed gland of the third eyelid. It is called cherry eye due to the (red) gland sticking out of the eye. This condition is an easy one to fix and not really painful but does require surgery. \n\nCleft palate (or minor cleft lip) \nThis is something puppies are born with. It can be caused by genetics but could also be caused in utero. If the female experiences dehydration, vitamin deficiency, exposure to certain chemicals, ect. Either way cleft palate pups will not be able to suckle properly and therefore they usually will not naturally survive. A cleft lip is a more minor cosmetic deformity and likely to have possibly the same causes as cleft palate- genetics or environment.\n\nDemodex\nThere are two types of demodectic mange localized and generalized. It is important to note that pretty much all dogs carry these mange mites but in a healthy dog they cause no disruption. \nLocalized Demodex involves a small \"local\" area of hair loss. This is typically seen on the paws or around the eyes. There is a genetic predisposition to Demodex as it is usually familial though times of heavy stress / other disease could see a reduced immune system leading to the body being unable to deal with the mites. Localized out breaks usually occur in pups and often can clear themselves up.\nGeneralized demodex can be much more severe and problematic. This very much seems to be a genetic issue (it possibly has something to do with T cell distribution). This type causes great amount of hair loss all over the body. It is often reoccurring & can be hard to treat effectively because there isn't a cure. The hair loss & mite \"infection\" can also lead to poor skin condition & secondary skin infection. In females coming into season is often associated with another out break so it is best to spay females as soon as possible in my opinion. \n\nDilated cardiomyopathy\nThis is another serious heart disease causing an enlarged and weakened heart. Eventually leading to heart failure. Exercise intolerance might be seen but there are not always symptoms early on. By the time serious symptoms such as fluid in the lungs appears you are already into heart failure stages. As with Aortic Stenosis a dog could suddenly die. \n\nEctropion\nThe eyelid rolls out ward, giving a \"droopy\" appearance. It isn't a serious condition for the dog but does require surgery. \n\nElbow Dysplasia\nThis can be a painful condition. Causing lameness, limping or in severity crippling the dog in the front end. In some cases surgery is required to correct the issue.  \n\nEntropion\nThis is when the eyes roll inward. This is a bit more serious compared to Ectropion. Since the eyelids roll inward the lids & lashes can cause pain & irritation to the eyes. They might also cause corneal ulcers. Surgery is needed to fix this. \n\nEpilepsy\nThis is a neurological disorder that causes episodes of seizures. It can be mild or very severe with frequent episodes. It can actually be seen in many breeds though it is more common in some, is certainly seen often enough to concern CC owners. While there is treatment there really isn't a cure. Some people I know have had their dogs seizures controlled in relatively short order for long term but in other cases it has required multiple adjustments in medication. \n\nHip Dysplasia\nThis disease can be serious and debilitating. The rate in Corsi is somewhat depressing. A mild case might not present with much symptoms, especially younger in life. However more severe case can be crippling. Symptoms can include limping, not wanting to jump or bare weight, an odd gate. It can be progressive and accompanied by degenerative joint disease. Surgery is often required. \n\nHypothyroidism \nDogs suffering from hypothyroidism can be asymptomatic or have very subtle symptoms. Weight gain, being unable to lose weight, low energy, hair loss can all be symptoms. Hypothyroidism is treated with medication that can help a dog live a normal life. Proper dosage is needed so it might take changes in medication levels but most hypo dogs live long lives. \n\nCancer can afflict nearly any animal, dogs are clearly no exception. There are both genetic and environmental factors for different types of cancers. One cancer that seems to be a problem in large breeds is Osteosarcoma. This is a serious bone cancer. It can be deadly, even with treatment many dogs only have an extended life,  they are not fully cured. Symptoms include lameness and pain, lack of energy, weight loss and loss of appetite. There could be physical swelling at the site of affliction.", 
    "Bloat, Cherry eye, Demodex, Elbow Dysplasia, Hip Dysplasia\nAre really the big ones for this breed and very common.\nFemales also seem to have a higher rates of Pyometra, this is not higher in the first few heat cycles but after 2 years of age why most advise making sure to spay a female that is not to be bred.", 
    "My female is 8yrs old no pyo  (knock on wood)\nI've heard it being higher in GSDs. I cant confirm that just what I heard.", 
    "Very interesting information, although I doubt whether I'll ever own a Cane Corso! What I didn't realise was that CC's are also prone to entropion,which is a common problem with Shar-Pei. \n\nI thought it might be worth pointing out that certainly with Pei there are two forms of entropion.  The first is genetic and normally occurs within the first few months of the puppy's life. Georgina was only 4 months old when she developed severe entropion which caused ulcerated cornea.  The second, Spastic Entropion, can occur at any time in the dog's life and might or might not be genetic.  My first Pei, M'boi developed spastic entropion at 18 months old due we think to all the dust in the air from the fields at the back of my house being ploughed.  In her case, because it was caught quickly all that was necessary was a simple operation to prevent her eyelashes from causing irritation to her cornea.  \n\nI'd advise any owner of a susceptible breed to regularly check their dog's eyes particularly if they start to weep as it's very important to catch it early before too much damage is done to the eyes.", 
    "Yes Entropion is more common in mastiff breeds, probably hounds too. As well as Ectropion. Any breed where they have wrinkles/excessive skin. I could see how it could be an issue in Shar Pei. \n\nThanks for adding that bit of knowledge on the condition. It seems (at least from my observation) that most CC develop Entropion as pups. \n\nI forgot one to mention one serious issue \n\nWobblers \nWobbler syndrome is a spinal disease. It can be very debilitating and costly. Dogs will wobblers \"wobble\" obviously, they also present will weakness, paralysis, drag their feet or knuckle over and muscle loss. It is painful to the dog with a high concentration of neck pain. \nSurgery can often be needed to correct cause of wobblers, in some dogs it can help a lot but other cases it only stops the progression but the dog will have issues for a lifetime.", 
    "Entropion I feel they bring from the Neo's they where created from and I would disagree on most mastiff breeds having it.\n\nWobblers while seen a lot in Danes, is pretty rare in the rest of the mastiff family.\n\nWhile yes there is a chance for both in all mastiff breeds,  Entropion is mainly Neo's, Fila's, and CC's. Neo and CC being the biggest 2. Which is still low for all 3.\n\nWobblers is so low in CC's I'm not sure if I would have listed it.", 
    "Yeah its a big problem in Neo must be all that skin! It's disgusting how they have bred them now. I think it's the biggest concern with the dogs of excessive skin but Presa Canario have pretty much the same health concerns as Cane Corso which includes Entropion. \n\nAs for wobblers, it's something to take into consideration when getting a CC. Even if it isn't very common like HD you should still be aware of it & the symptoms. I'm not sure of the rate but I don't know very many CC but know 2 with that issue. It was also something that really concerned me getting a Boerboel. It's often enough I know about Boerboel with it that I kept it in mind. Hips were my biggest concern though for either breed.",

I know of a few CC suffering epilepsy as well there was (probably still is) a \"breeder\" not to far from me producing epileptic dogs and cardiac issues among other problems. They were also selling a couple adult dogs few years back including a male producing problems. They were not selling him on pet contract or anything but as an intact dog. They've been breeding 15yrs I know of as they were breeding when my friend got her CC. They are nothing but a byb though, they clearly only care about money!\n\nMy other friends EM was diagnosed with epilepsy last year she was about year and a half. She will be 2 soon. Right now everything is under control. Though they were saying that they were seeing a change in her energy level & she seemed just not herself as much even though the meds did successfully control the seizures.\n\nI've known different breeds and even MIXES to have epilepsy. It is more common in some breeds and rarely seen in others. It's something to be aware of if you own a dog though.\n\nConsidering the breeds used to create the modern CC there are a number of diseases to be aware of. There are several breeds in the lineage. Then there is the fact that some imports have very short pedigrees not much to research. Some people don't even try. Good breeders do their best to obtain & produce healthy dogs but there are novelty owners either ignorant or don't care. In time more diseases could be seen or a higher rate, which would be unfortunate.",

Wrong. Not everyone has Internet or joins groups if they do. While vets are not perfect I'm sure that these epilepsy diagnosis in CC are correct. Epilepsy is seen in many breeds and even mixes, because the genes span breeds just like HD & numerous others. Vets diagnose it & breeders recognize this problem that you are trying to say doesn't exist in our breed.\n\nI'm not telling YOU about canine epilepsy. I posted on an online community for everyone. I never singled you out or made this thread to tell you anything. While I've never experienced it, I've friends with epileptic dogs so I know it can be trying but that doesn't make one an authority on which breeds do or do not have epilepsy. I'm not sure why it is so important for you to have it believed that epilepsy isn't in CC.\n\nI never stated anything you are accusing me of although I misunderstood what the Canine Epilepsy List is. I know my friends are not on that list, not every person with an epileptic dog is on that list. \n\nIf nothing is done to try and control it in CC (like pretend it doesn't exist) then eventually it can become more common & you might get to \"meet\" the owners on the List. That'd seem like a sad day as I'm glad it is uncommon in CC.", 
    "I made the health issue threads to give people an idea of potential breed specific health problem. Honestly trying to share information is all. I hope that no owners who read this will need to be concerned with it. In a perfect world no owners would ever have to be concerned with any health issue. \n\nAbout 15yrs ago I was helping a friend research Cane Corso and trying to help them find a breeder to get a puppy from. After doing so they still went to a byb located not too far from us. Maybe because that was easier, I don't know. 10yrs or so ago I started to really research them hard. Since I wanted a CC myself. I also corresponded with several breeders and visited some breeders too.\n\nI found some major concerns to be hip dysplasia, cardiac problems and epilepsy. These were serious and not something I ever wanted to experience. \n\nI had to find my old \"notes\" (electronic format) but there are a few kennels that have produced epilepsy and also a few specific dogs known to produce it so if you would have a dog who is their descendant (doesn't matter the kennel your dog came from) it could be a concern.  \n\nWhile I'm not going to put these individuals out there listing every kennel or dog I will mention one kennel. As they themselves acknowledge producing it. They stopped selling pups and totally revamped their breeding program to eliminate epileptic dogs. This is Rustic Kennels. They would probably be one to have good knowledge on this problem and some of the source dogs to produce it. More info than I myself could provide. \n\nI had come across this more recently \nhttp://www.sadb.org/Epilepsy\nThis is a French DDB organization working to find genes within their breed but it does make mention to molosser breeds including the Cane Corso & Dogo Argentino, due to relation it is possible the same genes. I'm sure in time as a test hopefully develops they can also check for use in E. Mastiff, Boerboel (I know some research is being done with them already too), Presa Canario, Central Asian Shepherd, Neopolitan Mastiff and any other related breeds suffering from this horrible disease. \nOne of the researchers working on this is from Antagene Lab (located in France), they have pioneered tests including the Neonatal Cerebellar Ataxia which is found in the AmStaff. Optigen actually sends the genetic test sample for NCL-A to Antigene. Let's hope they can create one for epilepsy as well. \u263a\n\nWanted to add. I only learned about hypothyroidism after getting my CC. While this isn't usually serious in that it is controlled with meds leading to a usually normal life it can become epidemic within a breed if breeders are not careful. \n\nThe Cane Corso is a fairly young breed so more health issues could be lurking in the gene pool to be seen intime.",

    "Swiped from the web..\n\r\nThe Cane Corso is a very rare and ancient Italian breed that has been derived from the now extinct Roman Molosser. It is believed that, in ancient times, this historic Roman Molosser gave rise to two very different breeds of dog. One dog was massive and became known as the Neapolitan Mastiff, the other was a taller, lighter more agile mastiff which has become known as the Cane Corso. As the Romans bred dogs based on their usability, the Cane Corso was used primarily for hunting big game such as wild boar, wolf and bear and also guarding property and livestock from large predators such as wolves and human cattle thieves. \n\r\nOver the years, as big game hunting declined, the Cane Corso was used by farmers to herd cattle, protect the livestock and as a guard for the family home. The breed prospered with the flourishing agricultural economy during the 19th century and the years between World War 1 and World War II. After World War II, farms became increasingly modernised and there was little need for Corsos thus breed numbers decreased and the breed almost became extinct. Luckily, there were a few specimens which existed in isolated parts of Southern Italy where traditional activities were carried out. In these isolated places, the breed lived on, less used as working dogs but maintained for passion and tradition. It was due to the desire of a few families who wished to conserve the dogs inherited from their ancestors that the breed survived.",

But, if left unattended in our back garden, he ends up in their's.\n\nSo, in spite of the hot weather, we decided to keep the french doors closed.  So, he now jumps through the window.  All this is probably because he once saw a cat in next door's garden and needs to check if it's still there.\n\nAnd I have learned that if he wants to sniff something when he's on the lead, it is better to be patient and let him satisfy his curiosity.  Otherwise, as soon as he's let off the lead in the field, he'll turn round and rush back to check out the smell.\n\nAnd there is no hedge thick enough to stop him when he picks up the scent of a pheasant.\n\nProbably a cocker spaniel thing!",

    "I knew a lady at agility who had a working cocker, couldnt tell you what kind of lines it was from and the little dog seriously gave me a headache. How it's owner coped with it I shall never know, and i'm not shy when it comes to dogs with energy! This dog was like it was on ecstacy or speed all the time and it just whizzed round and round without stopping for a moment. TBH, it had too much energy because it was that high on running about, it had little capacity to actually listen.\n\nPicking up on the hunting drive - this annoys me terribly. I hate to see spaniels (or any other hunting gundog) stuck permanently on a lead because the owner either cant be bothered, or doesnt have the skills to train the dog sufficiently. The homework and lifestyle assesment has obviously been bypassed in favour of the 'good family pet' image and easily manageable size.\n\nOn the beach at the weekend and there were 2 show cockers stuck on a lead whilst every other dog was running free. My neighbour has a working type springer who has never, ever been off a lead in its 7 years because he \"runs off\". So it gets a 1 mile walk twice a day round exactly the same field. I doubt it has ever swum, crashed about in undergrowth or run until it's tongue is lolling. Absolutely not fair IMO and since the gundog group is the most popular amongst dog owners, there are far too many dogs living inadequate lives through the lack of knowledge of their owners.",

We moved on and he did it again. I told my friend to see if he could develop this and not to make him sit, but praise him and then sit him after the flush.

    "Hi Pippam,\n\r\nI adopted a 3 year old Cocker bitch last year. She came to me in quite a state mentally, as she had been rather mistreated.  \n\r\nShe was terrified of older men (especially if they had grey hair!), other dogs, the outdoors, in fact everything! She did not know any commands, or how to be walked on a lead ( I don't think she was ever walked)! I honestly think that other than being bashed around, nothing had been done with her. She was very anxious all the time and would not settle down and rest. She shied, barked and ran away at every little noise, and one of the things that upset me the most, was that unlike all other Cockers I had ever known, she would never EVER wag her tail, instead, keeping it tightly tucked under her all the time.:-( \n\r\nDespite the above, she had a very sweet and gentle nature, and was just in need of some TLC to to settle down her nervousness, build her confidence, and reassure her that nothing bad was going to happen to her any more.  \n\r\nI was keen to work on rehabilitating her, however due to her mental state, I knew I would have to take things very, very slowly, as her level of anxiety really restricted her ability to learn.\n\r\nAfter six months of letting her settle in to life with me with lots of cuddles, gentle walks and general stress-free living, she was really starting to change into a more confident and wonderfully affectionate companion. She loves nothing more than curling up on my lap and snoring loudly! (In fact she is sprawled out on the sofa next to me happily out of it as I type). At this point I started doing some gentle training with her.\n\r\nShe will have been with me a year come next month, and she is truly a lovely dog. She is always with me, following me from room to room wherever I go. She still barks from time to time, especially if someone unknown to her comes to our house, but generally settles down quickly. Other than a bit of barking, she really doesn't have any problems.\r\nShe is now great on the lead, never runs away, is very good around other dogs, and now LOVES going out for walks.\n\r\nMy point in saying all this is that, if my Cocker, who was in a bad way, can still be a wonderful dog just by being given the right attention, time and love, then I believe most rescue dogs (who haven't previously shown any aggression) shouldn't be a problem at all, and I would highly recommend helping a dog who needs a great home.\n\r\nIf your existing Cocker is generally chilled out and happy, it would easily help build the confidence of a new dog; it helped no end with mine.\n\r\nI love taking her for walks now and seeing her holding her tail high and happily wagging it. If you have the time; rescue!  \n\r\nI say go for a second!", 
    "Thats a sweet story ^^\n\r\nIm glad your dog has a happy ending and a good life now!\n\r\nMillie is pretty laid back now. I can even cuddle her at last! She would not let me do this before I'd have my fingers off otherwise. She we'nt through a really stressed out phase but is now really relaxed with life. She is happy to sit on her bench, pooter around the garden while I water the plants and feed the chickens or  go for a walk I think she would really enjoy having her own around with her. \n\r\nI guess one of the others things I am not really sure about having another energetic dog.",

If you watch a springer working the tail is high, a cocker tail is low, and as they work, they are like a suction cup, or should be, nose down tail down but moving to indicate whether they are onto something or not.  What part of that is the *cocking* spaniel I don't know, but I am not convinced that the cocker is bred solely to flush woodcock, but am convinced more that because they are bred for a different action than the springer, that the name derives from that.

    "I used to be heavily involved in a shoot and one of the guns and pickers up had a couple of show cockers. He had just started shooting and decided to bring his dogs along.

    "During my research into Working Cockers, I came to the conclusion that Show ones can work but they do not have the high drive that working ones do, so if you wanted one for fun then yes they'll kinda do the job but if you want to properly work it in the field than a show will not be up to it", 
    "I was puzzled by this question so asked on a gundog forum I am on and found out that in France, their working cockers have little difference to what our Show Cockers are and it would seem there is no clear cut, like there is here.

It's difficult enough to produce a specific type of working animal even for the working lines breeders, so adding the additinal criteria of sticking to the current show type too would make it even harder (I think!)",

This \"fast tracks\" the whole process and those genes that distinguish the Corgi and Boxer and which appear to be amazingly few in number, are rapidly diluted out. Add to this the fact that the main unwanted Corgi genes (for leg length and coat) are dominant to their Boxer equivalents, such that once lost they are gone forever. There is no real risk of Corgi features being maintained over the generations to reappear with inbreeding. And, clearly, there will be many more generations of crossing to Boxer before there is any liklihood of \"doubling up\" on Corgi - other than for experimental purposes.\" (Bruce Cattanch, Boxer 2001, p.59)",

    "The bobtail gene was introduced in a single cross. Through breeding Boxers carrying that gene to other Boxers the results after 4 generations were dogs that looked like Boxers, behaved like Boxers, had the Boxer temperament, bred true apart from the tails, and were in fact Boxers   That is rather different to the continued first generation crossings that produce the popular 'oodles' and 'poos'.\n\r\nIt depends what result is desired and how responsibly the programe is carried out and how well researched the likely results may be. I think it acceptable to add new blood in the form of introducing a cross to another breed if it is done for the benefit of the breed in question, eg if it is a vulnerable/rare breed or if it may eliminate serious health issues.

It depends what you mean by better results, it takes years to breed to type,breeding /selecting/ over and over until you have consistency and then the standard is set.To change a feature takes a knowledge of breeds/genetics and repeating the whole process of breeding/selection until you have the desired effect .\n\nTake my own breed for instance, it was decided a smaller version of the tough little Schnauzer was required as dogs became companions and not just working dogs, so in the 1899s the Miniature Schnauzer was created in Germany. They are not 'miniaturised' Schnauzers i.e. they were not achieved by keeping the runt of the litter, it is generally though the were arrived at by crossing the Schnauzer with the Affenpinscher (and maybe other breeds no one is sure) then they were bred and selected until type was achieved. \n\nThe breed has evolved and the present day Minins look a little different to the originals for example they have longer furnishings, but in most respects they are  the same dogs with the same characteristics. As the standard stipulates furnishings but not the length the dogs  still comply with the original standard....there are other slight variations but all within the breed standard. \n\nIt was decided to introduce a white version of the breed with all the problems that go with the genetics of white dogs (I better not say who did this and why) . These are a 'variation' of the original and not 'better results' and a variation of which I do not approve. \n\nRe the gene pool and health, the original breed spread out all over the world and different blood lines formed creating a large gene pool, so if you wish to introduce new blood lines there is plenty of stock out there to use for this purpose. Yes problems occurred in the form of eye disease and I think this may have occured from the over use of certain stud dogs and people not understanding that their was a problem until the damage was done . The eye problems like similar ones in other breeds can be eradicated if people stick to the rules, test their dogs and don't breed from affected lines.", 
    "I should have made it clear that my reference to 'miniaturization' was directed at runt breeding and the deliberate breeding of chondrodysplasic dogs rather than the rigorous breeding programs designed to create such breeds as the Mini Schnauzer  \n\r\nIt should also be borne in mind that the early breeders who 'created' breeds did indeed have very stringent breeding programs which meant that many dogs which did not meet their vision for the breed would have been culled.",

I dont believe they should be bred from which requires them to be registered.\n\r\nI know many yrs ago whites where culled, but today most breeders recognise that  whites are just as popular  as their coloured siblings..\n\r\n Being white and deaf dont do hand in hand.\n\r\nAs you will know, if you breed from flashies you are likely to get a couple of white in a litter,  but being white does not automatically guarantee deafness..\n\r\nIf you do have a deaf pup, than that is completey  different..  and I understand that by not registering them , you are hopefully safeguarding it from unscrupulous breeding.\n\r\nYou as a breeder will also know that  selling a pup unregistered is not going to safeguard it from someone who has intentions of breeding from it, what ever the colour , or the restrictions you place on the pups.\n\r\nAs there are  people in this world  who will breed no matter what endorsements you place on your pups...  \n\r\nAnd as they are unregistered , it will make little different to the unscrupulous... \n\r\nYou say you dont register your whites, yet you put endorsements on them, \"not for breeding\"\n\r\nI dont understand why you would endorse and unregistered pup...as the fact it is unregistered will speak for itself.\n\r\nI think , many also feel that to unregister a white  gives them a lesser standing , when in fact they are (if healthy) should have the same privilege as their siblings.\n\r\nAs you say, some Boxers breeders dont register , but many do....  ensuring a good forever home should apply whether you are selling whites or   standard dogs.. the same care should be taken regardless.",

I acknowledge that I own a powerful, tenacious and drivey breed. Though even if I owned a breed that was not this way I would still be responsible, it is just that my breed usually takes more management. I think we just look at / word things differently. I don't think dogs need taming, they are domesticated animals. But they do need training and restraining - incidents I've seen with my breed have at times been an indoor pet with an unstable temperament BUT a big portion is either HA dog kept in a backyard fence that can easily be escaped and some cases the dog inside dog is human aggressive (total flaw) and a door darter (no training). Other times kenneled, chained or fenced yard escapes and attacks other dogs or pets. It is up to owners too properly contain their dogs and too many fail. Some might get hit by cars, impounded or poisoned and others cause problems as stated above.",

I just know they are within the weight range thats within the standard. And they should have a balanced height to weight ratio. I always forget about lbs vs kgs I try to remember as I know I converted when talking with Carole. \n\nI keep mine at a leaner pet weight than average, but it is not as lean and as muscled as conditioned weight. What I have read is that some body fat is good, but that being a little light is better than a little heavy healthwise. Of course I try to keep them at an ideal weight and if the body has no fat / dog isn't getting enough calories that could lead to health problems (just as anorexia or issues causes extreme under weight in humans) have detrimental effects on the body and brain. \nI think it is great you keep your little one at a fit weight.

Apparently there are some dedicated to actually intentionally having over weight dogs and these people almost have competition to see who can have the fattest (cutest) dog. I only recently learned about this. Pretty shocking.", 
    "Oh, Tikki is definitely fit - if you could see her leaping up and doing twirlies in mid-air you would have no doubt about that!  If she would only come out for walks with me on my big mobility scooter - but she will not.  However she is on a 12metre tether all day, and unless it is raining heavily she goes out and races about at will as the door is always open - which together with the 12m she can race indoors, gives her plenty of exercise.  And she is definitely perfectly balanced [raw] fed.  \n\nI am just not used to seeing a slim [no, she is not skinny, not looking at your gorgeous girl, just slim] as Lexi, who was small, weighed 5.5-6 kilos but being long-coated it was impossible to see her shape.  I could pick her up though.  Tikki is maybe 5.6-6g - I will know when Ram comes here to weigh her for the Parkworm shot, I think due 26 this month.  But she is far too strong for me to pick up - unless she wants me to!  \n\nPereg started full growth at 17 kilos [work it out for yourself] but due to her epilepsy and medication, ended up at ~22 kg and had been fed raw for since I learned about it.  And when she was post-ictal she would scream for food for hours after a seizure as only food seemed to [eventually] calm her.  I definitely had not been able to pick her up since she was a small puppy.  She was not long-coated but definitely had a double-coat which meant it was not really possible to see her actual shape.\n\nAnd - Tikva, being a cross between a standard smooth Dachshund and a MinPin, both breeds tending to easily get obese, [and also both having epilepsy in their breeds, hence Tikva, which means \"hope\"] - and with such a very short coat, it is so easy to see her actual shape - her muscles, ribs, even most of her spine.  Which makes me sure that she really is getting all she needs.\n\nSo seeing those pictures of Morgi made me realise that Tikki is not skinny, she is just slim - and she is rock solid, although of course not as solid as Morgi.  \n\nThank you.",

    "Just thought I would share this as an educational post \n\nSkinny dogs\n\n\"SKINNY\" DOGS? -\n\nI thought I would write this for all the people on here who ask questions and are willing to learn but may not have their questions answered correctly or at all due to arguing or people without proper knowledge or a full understanding of what is asked answering the questions. I will try my best to answer and cover the common questions pertaining to this subject. This is addressing the \"skinny\" dog pictures.  We have all seen the pictures posted with what most people who have never seen a conditioned dog refer to as \"skinny\". Here is a picture of Tea, this shows a fit looking, well exercised and muscled dog. She is playing with a flirt pole..\n\n \n\nNow, if you are reading this and never have seen this what do you think? What do you see? You, like many others, probably look straight at the lines on the side, the ribs and the spine bumps showing. When most people see ribs on a dog they think what? The dog is skinny! The dog is underfed, abused, neglected, starved! Well now thats not always the case, allow me to explain..First off, lets go over what it means to have a conditioned dog.. Conditioning a dog in essence means to exercise and feed your dog so that it is at peak physical condition, much like an athlete does in preperation for a season of a sport. People may condition a dog for many reasons, some being reasons being.. dog shows, weight pulling competitions, dock diving, lure coursing or just to better their dogs health and fitness.When a person conditions a dog the dog will, just like people, lose the excess fat from its body. When this happens muscles become more pronounced, and yes ribs (and sometimes spine) will show. You may wonder, why if a dog is being exercised will the ribs show?  Well... lets look at a picture of some dog muscle anatomy! \n\n \nSee the triangular shaped muscle that the arrow is pointing to. That is the Latissimus dorsi muscle, or Lat muscle. That covers the rib cage on a dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn this picture of Franzi's dog Chilly, you can see the Lat mucle as indicated by the arrow. You can see the clear lines forming that triangle shape. This muscle, like all muscles, require exercises (and in some cases, genetics) to become visible. Conditioning of a dog, as stated above, removes most if not all of the excess fat from the dog. Now what mostly covers the ribs of a dog is what? Fat. When all that excess fat is burned off it leaves the ribs only to be covered by the Lat muscle.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHere is Tea, this is what she looks like wearing her \"winter weight\". She is not conditioned in this picture.. See how no mucsle tone or ribs are visible at all, everything is covered by a layer of fat.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThis is Tea after 3 weeks of conditioning. Notice how that layer of fat has been exercised off and you can see all the muscles and the Lat line covering the ribs. A few ribs are slightly visible. Now lets go over other exercises and how genetics come into play! The Lat muscle is a very hard to define muscle in some dogs. Some dogs will show a perfectly defined Lat muscle just from running alone, some require other exercises (like springpole or drag work) to even get the muscle to show a small amount, if at all. This is because genetics sometimes just dont permit it to be as pronounced on one dog as it is on the other. Some dogs, like Chilly and Tea, have a easily seen Lat muscle and some dogs dont. Does it mean one dog is being \"starved\" and the other isnt? No. It just means one dogs body is different than another, kind of like the how one persons body will differ from another persons when exercised. Another issue with pictures posted of dogs in a conditioned or well exercised state is what the dog is doing when the picture is taken. This is commonly a problem because the dogs have little fat on them, which means their ribs are only being covered by the Lat muscle which may or may not be extremely well defined, so if the picture is taken while exercising or inhaling deeply, the ribs may be more visible than what they normally are when the dog is in a resting state. This will lead to the dog looking extremely \"ribby\" when it is in fact not at all. Had the picture been taken when the dog was exhaling or at one second later the dog would have little to no rib showing, depending on the dogs body structure and how their Lat muscle is defined. \n\n\n\n\n\n \nHere is a picture of Turbo exercising on a slat mill, as you can see in the picture he was caught while inhaling, notice how the ribs are clearly visible..\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNow here is Turbo again, but the picture was taken a second later while he wasnt deeply inhaling..Notice how the ribs that were so clearly visible before are now covered by the Lat muscle and only a hint of the last few are visible. It makes all the difference in what second the picture was taken on whether or not the dog looks overly \"ribby\".\n\n\n\nSome other comments made about dogs in a conditioned state are \"This dog looks nice, but I like more meat on my dogs\" or something similar, is this wrong? No! Each person has what they like a dog to look like, some people like to keep their dogs very fit and in peak physical condition. That isnt really what all people prefer to do and its perfectly fine! Some people like a dog to be kept at more of a pet weight, NOT OBESE, but not quite as conditioned as the dogs pictured above. Again, that is fine. So long as people understand that a dog in that body condition is not emactiated, neglected, skinny, etc. and that it takes a lot of work to get a dog to look like that and quite a lot of food for the dog to be able to get into that condition. So in essence the comments about a dog being \"starved\" into that condition are completely false and in fact IMPOSSIBLE. \n\n \n\nThat goes into the last part of this, the idea that you can somehow starve or cut feed to achieve the results above. That is impossible for the simple fact that, when a dog (or human) is starved, after the fat is gone, the muscle is quick to follow. So instead of a dog looking like the dogs above it looks like...\n\n \n\nThat dog looks nothing like the dogs pictured above. That is because the dog was starved. You can see how all the bones in the dog are visible. Every rib is clearly visible when the dog is in a relaxed pose, the top of the rib care is clearly visible, there is zero hint of a Lat muscle covering the ribs. The hip points and entire spine is visible, there is zero muscle covering those areas at all. That and the dog has little to no muscle mass in its legs, as well as the gut area being sunken in. The dogs starving body cannibalised the muscle tissue to keep itself alive after it used what fat it had. This is not the same, nor is it close to the dogs posted on this page.\n\n\nI hope this answered some of the questions people have pertaining to the \"skinny\" dogs posted and helped the people who truly want to know about the conditioned dogs this page posts.\n\n\n*All photos used (except the last one of the emaciated dog) are of American Pit Bull Terriers. Slight variations are expected when other breeds such as the American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, or American Bully are conditioned. Each breed conditioned will look somewhat different due to breed standard and body structure.", 
    "Interesting post Katie, thanks for sharing.\n\nI would describe them more as 'ripped'/defined. The last photo is definitely of an emaciated dog.\n\nI actually prefer the photo of Tea with her \"winter weight\".\n\nThe funny thing is if half the people who keep their dogs in this condition paid the same attention to themselves, we'd be a fitter nation",

Amazing looking dogs we have an american bulldog at work thats muscled like your dogs. he does weight pulling competitions and doesnt have a scrap of fat on him just solid muscle but i can understand people getting confused as he can also look a bit bony at times depending whats hes doing. he's called egg, had to tell you that as i find it so funny", 
    "Excellent post! I hate when American Bully owners and general people call the dogs \"malnourished\". My previous dog was crossed with game lines (RedBoy according to the person who bred him) and he was skinny kinda like that when he was in condition, which was rare since he was just a lowly Labrador mix. As he got old... he kind of wasted away to a bony rail dog, but as a young fit dog... he was in GOOD SHAPE and lived to 15.\n\nI always got asked on his old YouTube channel (and also in real life)... \"WHY is that Lab so skinny?\" And \"do you feed him\"? And it was UGH for ages. I always said I love the American Pit Bull Terriers, not just \"pit bulls\". Real APBT look like THOSE dogs you featured, excellent condition. Tea looks great, good job!\n\nHere was my Brownie in prime condition:\n\n\n\nLike you said... some rib and Lat muscle clearly visible. No fat on that dog at all. He was not as muscular as an APBT as he was a mutt. He was not short haired and his skin was looser because of the Lab, but still. That's what I love about the APBT. Even a LITTLE bit can truly do wonders for the dogs physical shape. But all Brownie got called was SKINNY and WEAK. \n\nTruly unfair, because the only reason is due to lack of knowledge about how dogs really should look... especially the APBT which are NOT the block headed, stout dogs most people think they are. \n\nMy current two dogs are just pudgy puppies... but Jade is 11 and Nigredo has no pitty in him at all. I scarcely come across a fat one. Never really unless very old, and even still not usually. I'll always love the APBT and am so glad to see this post. Thank you.", 
    "Ooops non of my pitbulls looked like any of the above photos, they all look like fighting dogs to me,  1 of my pitbulls I had was heavy set (not fat) like Cesar Millan's lovely small  pitbull Daddy was, whereas my other one looked like Cesar Millan's  tall pitbull the beautiful Junior.\nThe picture of Tea after 3 weeks of conditioning. reminds me of a dog that as been conditioned ready to fight, as does the pictures of Turbo.\n\nI also hate seeing them chained up with thick heavy chains & wear thick collars, they are dogs not monsters a normal harness/collar lead is all that's required.",

Its very rare for a blue dog to be an APBT as blue was traditionally culled out or rarely bred from. Also another tell tale sign is that you rarely ever see cropped ears on an ABPT.\n\nI guess when they are conditioned they are conditioned as they would bee for fighting, but are used instead for sports or hunting.\n\nThick collars are needed as they are usually encouraged to pull, again to help build up muscle, if normal width collars are used then the dog is likely to damage its neck and throat.\n\nHere is my favourite bitch. OMK's Little Sky", 
    "Yup, ANY short or stout dog is NOT a pit bull bred from true APBT game lines. Pit bulls are NOT always APBT. Sorry about it, but it's facts. Also, these dogs are surely not fighting dogs as I don't see scars on them and they don't have crops.\n\nFighting dogs almost always have short \"battle\" crops. APBT true to type are rarely kept as just indoor pets, and if you owned one... you'd know why. No blues or \"greys\", no crooked legs, and NO stout looking dogs. What you had 6JRT's weren't APBT, they were \"pit bulls\" which is totally different.\n\nThis is why the TRUE APBT has fallen out of fashion, because people would rather have a \"pit bull\" than a true working grade APBT. I don't like the chaining them up and whatnot, but as I've said... these are working dogs and truly don't often do well indoors when kept like Pomeranians.\n\nJunior is an American Bully with his stubby build and blueish coloring. That ugly \"blue\" color you're seeing is the Gottiline or Razors Edge type stuff. American Bully lines. True APBT aren't blue. Jocko, RedBoy, Red Rum, Colby, Chinaman, Spike, etc. REAL lines of APBT are not blue.\n\nThe true APBT is a rare breed these days, so I appreciate seeing real ones in condition instead of the short, stout dogs I keep seeing that people are calling pit bulls when really they are closer to Bandogges or American Staffords. They are barely even healthy half the time...\n\nGoing edit to say... When a dog is on a spring pole etc. it shouldn't be allowed to hang without being able to touch the ground with it's legs. Any APBT owner should know that and stop trying to show off like that. The dog should NOT be hanging way above the ground like that. I DO hate seeing that.", 
    "Excellent post Katie, with some fantastic looking dogs! With obesity in dogs on the increase, people really need to know what a fit, conditioned, dog looks like.\n\nMy boy isn't an APBT, but if you look at his body in the picture below you can see how well defined his muscles are. He's rock solid. Although, I would say he's a few pounds overweight to be honest. But it seems to be more \"middle aged spread\" then anything \n\n \n\nComing towards you, you can see his muscle tone in his back legs especially.",

Yes ears bleed a lot if ripped but in a fight if the ears of dog #1 are grabbed and held onto then it is very easy for #1 to swing its head underneath and grab dog #2's throat which would be a very good advantage to a fighting dog\n\nI dont mind seeing a dog hanging on a springpole personally as long as it is not too high from the ground and there is someone close by. When the dog is able to touch the floor it gives good muscle build up but hanging increases the core muscles and also the jumping is practiced a lot for competitions.\n\n\n\n\nDogloverlou said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nExcellent post Katie, with some fantastic looking dogs!

Pitbulls should be fit and strong, able to weight pull heavy amounts, should be agile, and able to jump far easily and efficantly, and they should be able to travel at a decent speed easily, as they are still 'terriers' they should be therefore able to be fast enough and agile, and should be able to do all this without extra bone, head and body impacting on any of it. I'm sorry but I really think that its a shame when people get it into their heads that dogs look better this way or that, and everything else goes out the window, or takes a back seat including health, but where in the (grisly) history of the pit bull would looking like a hippo benefit them? All that body and weight would put them at such a disadvantage in thd ring, a more agile dog would be able to move about more quicklh, and they are 'bull terriers for a reason, and although we don't want dogs killing each other, or showing their game by approaching the line first towards the other dog, for our enjoyment (well the decent people anyway) why do we want a totally different dog, that seems all bull and no terrier, when the clues in the title, it should posses qualitys from both.

Also, less typing for pedigrees and entry forms!Click to expand...\n\nIf a purchaser adds their affix to the end of the name and registered it as such with the UK KC, it will still be registered as affix of the breeder, registered name of the dog [by the breeder], then \"of\" and the affix of the purchaser, if they have one.  The bitch I was given by my mentor was registered as her affix and then the name she was registered as, and when I gave her the choice of the two puppies she had, she then signed her over to me with the KC.  So she was then her affix, the name she had registered of the bitch, and then \"of\" my affix.  .\n\nBut even though she was then officially mine, she was still the registered breeder and had I wanted to show her it would have been under the name of her breeder, not under my name.  Sure she had the full name, but the breeders name came first.", 
    "That's right - the breeders affix comes first (prefix), and the owners (if a different person) affix goes at the end (suffix), usually with some kind of a conjunction. I like, 'at' or 'for', - but whatever flows best.\nIt wasn't always so, if you look at historic records, some kennels always used a suffix, (like the 'of Ware' Cocker's, I think the only Kennel to go BIS at Crufts three times). I think it was during the '60's that the use of affixes was standardised, and the rule was not popular with everyone at the time. \nThis thread is really making me yearn for the joys of breeding dogs. Choosing the sire, the anticipation, evaluating your pick, and selecting the right sounding names. Then the ringcraft training, and waiting to see what the competition will be when we hit the ring. Makes me wish I could turn the clock back twenty years or so.",

Hence why we have a shih tzu, well that is one reason . The other was a small dog was only accepted  where we lived. Louie also, has his requirements, he doesn't like dogs much bigger than himself, as he becomes defensive if, they are young and boisterous. I'm not sure what he would be like with an older dog though as he seems OK when out on walks...

I was hoping for a different breed as his breed really just like to Sniff every tree and plod along, not really playful which is lovely in its self and wouldn't change him and he  was so, so stubborn as a pup and very hard work. We came  to a compromise that when I say 'wait' he will stop and do just that, wait but he won't come to you, you have to go to him. So, i was hoping for a breed we could have more outdoor fun with, and probably easier to train. I just don't think Louie has ever been bothered, I think it  is because he was born in Portugal and considers himself as,  Portuguese and everything is Amanha, tomorrow will do, the forever tomorrow that never comes  \nHowever, I do get the same breed knowing each other...

I have been tempted by border terrier or Caine terrier but not sure about the \"terrier\" side. I did own a jack Russel but he became very aggressive with my son and bit him twice, once we forgave but the second time we just couldn't have him doing this and my son would only have to pass by me or come over to me. He was fine as a puppy but became very territorial of me, in the end my brother took him as he doesn't have children.

We did all the \"right things\" researching dog positive training techniques, enrolling him in obedience, we are always firm with emphasis on rewarding the positive and diverting attention from the negative. my partner takes him to his office on the days I work, he is almost always with one of us, with the exception of a couple hours here or there. we take him to a great doggy daycare where he gets along with the other dogs if we take longer than four hours, we feed him a high quality diet, right from the start we socialized him daily with all kinds of dogs and people, he was always so playful and confident. so how come out of the blue he has randomly become dog aggressive!? I am horrified. he suddenly has become a bully and I feel like I cannot predict what he is going to do any longer. sometimes he ignores dogs completely, sometimes he wants to play, and sometimes he fully attacks (to my human eyes) for no reason totally friendly dogs. the only consistency I can find is that they are often younger than him and bigger. He has attacked a Rhodesian ridgeback, a vizsla, german shepherd, boarder collie. It is so embarrassing, I feel like I look like a terrible dog owner, but I am not! luckily he has never picked on a dog smaller than himself, and he has never drawn blood or ripped out fur. Is he just being a terrier? is there nothing I can do? He always played scrappy, and I know its in his nature, but this is definitely not just rough play, it is full on attack mode. now I wont even take him to dog parks out of fear. I feel like I have failed...", 
    "I would stay away from dog parks, he doesn\u2019t need to interact with unknown dogs.\nStart training him to ignore other dogs, at first keep enough distance from them so that he doesn\u2019t get worked up.\n Make yourself more interesting than the other dogs, by distracting him with a toy/titbit or get him to play when you see another dog coming (hopefully before he does)",

We haven't ruled out cushings but the vet has told us it is very unlikely.Click to expand...\n\nHi Deana, I have only just joined the group & I was immediately drawn to your conversation & was wondering how your dog is doing & have you got any further with what her problem is? My 13 year old border terrier Toby, about a month ago, started with the same problems drinking loads of water, never seeming to quench his first & urinating in his bed & in the house, which he hasn't done before, no paw licking though. Took him to our vets & he tested Toby for diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus & Cushing disease & Addison's disease, all tests came back inconclusive, so the vet thought the problem was some sort of obsessive-compulsive disorder, so off we went with pills to see if this helps, diazepam 10mg, 3 times a day & he's not doing so good so far, infact the urinating is a bit less but I am restricting water, small amounts often, but Toby now seems mithered & unsettled, so I'm going back to the vets tomorrow! I'm getting really worried now, what started out as an annoying urinating problem has now turned into something far more serious. I'd be really interested to know how your border terrier is?",

    "This is a difficult topic as the tests for Cushing's, Addison's, and Diabetes Insipidus are not straightforward.

As much as I love having a puppy I\u2019m even more excited about having a \u2018proper adult dog\u2019 as we are yet to find a middle ground between manic and fast asleep! \n\r\nI\u2019m finding Border Terrier\u2019s are very much a marmite type of dog, people either love them or think they\u2019re mad but I have a fairly active life style being a horse owner so although we do work full time he will also be spending a lot of time out of the house exercising, although at the moment he seems to be quite cold outside in the mornings and not too happy about being out!\n\r\nAnyway, this is my gorgeous puppy:\n\n\r\nWould love to hear from other Border owners \n\r\nFinally, I really like the idea of doing agility, he\u2019s a very clever little dog and I think we\u2019d both enjoy it, I know he\u2019s too young to really start doing any \u2018proper\u2019 training but I just wondered if anyone else did agility with their Border\u2019s and ideas of fun games we could play (that won\u2019t stress young joints!). I\u2019m going to try and get him on the waiting list for our local group as I think they are usually fully booked!", 
    "What a sweetheart!  I have 2 (mother Tarn and son Jim) nearly 4 years and 10 months.  \n\r\nThey are such great little dogs with sooo much about them.  I don't do agility but judging by my 2, I'm sure they could do it.\n\r\nThere are quite a few border owners on here.  \n\r\nWelcome to the board \n\r\nHelen",

The breeder says he was the smallest of the 5 when born, but is now the biggest! as he really loves his food apparently  .

    "Breeze is a normal grizzle and tan like any other grizzle and tan.  A lighter one thats all.  We only have 4 colours in Borders.\nRed\nGrizzle and tan\nBlue and tan\nWheaten.  \nThere has not been a true wheaten in around 30/40yrs.  That colour is considered none existent in Borders now.\n\n\nBreeze is NOT wheaten.  She has black in her coat which makes her grizzle and tan.\n\nThanks for the nice comments Helen.  Im sure yours are gorgeous too.",

We would also consider the right rescue pup.\n\r\nIt is about matching the right dog/pup to the household, we have our son and Cosmo to consider so it is a tricky one,I trust the Guide Dog people and FCR rescue people to only suggest the right type of dog for us, but we could be waiting a long time....it's a tough one. \n\r\nI am leaning towards an older dog as we are a bit puppied out...but if the right pup came along of a breed we like....\r\nWe are considering Borders and Springers (although OH doesn't want the latter) because they are smaller...a Border is the only small breed I would seriously consider, although my oH and son want a corgi!  \n\r\nDecisions decisions...but such nice ones!!!!!! We will know when it is the right dog..", 
    "What an exciting time.  Obviously I think it would be GREAT if you got a GSD   But if not, a border terrier is a reasonable substitute ;-)  They are about the only small dog I would consider too!  \n\r\nI will watch with interest",

    "I have just aquired a Border Terrier who was a stray - initially thought to be quite old but once through 3 doses of wormer/a carrier bag of matted fur & a dental - he has been aged at approx 2!\r\nHe's now had his Vaccs, got a chip & snip.\r\nHe's an absolute darling with the cats & my chi x.\n\r\nWhat I want to know is when does this fur stop coming out?!!! His coat is a bit bizzare having had a complete matted fur shell on his back.  If I groom him daily will this just keep taking the undercoat out - (worried he will have nothing left!)...or will the coat get into its own rythm now he's been groomed?\n\r\nHe doesn't seem to have the blindest interest in vermin - walked past a rat 3ft away & he looked in the opposite direction & didn't even take the present the cat brought him (a live mouse!).  is he a real Border??!!  \n\r\nWhen he is walked he seems to be in a complete world of his own.  His nose is in absolute overdrive and I recon you could chop his leg off & he wouldn't notice.  \n\r\nHe is currently wearing the 'cone of shame' because he was castrated on Friday - had his stitches out friday night - skin stapled on saturday - had 2 of those out saturday night! \n\r\nAny Border advice would be greatly recieved,\r\nThank you x",

I did have a tentative go at stripping him once I got rid of his 'hair shell'!  which pretty much lifted off him.

    "Yes someone was with me when I did it.  They used to own a grooming business.  She said that because of his matting his first time round wouldn't look as good as it should.  I didn't hurt him if thats what you're thinking anything that didn't want to come out didn't. And as advised his sensitive parts such as under belly & face weren't touched.  He actually fell asleep when I did it, and then about fell over when I stopped!\r\nOther than grooming - are there any typical Border characteristics that the books don't tell you about?",

Just comb the undercoat out with a metal tooth comb, do not use any of the \"coat king\" types on him because they ruin them.  He does need stripping properly and you have made a great start.

    "My Border Terrier bitch, Bramble is only 9 months old, and potentially looks like a great showdog. The problem is that her mum had quite wide ribs, and I am worried hers may become very wide too. At the moment I can just about fit my hands round her ribs, but Im worried she will still grow. When will her ribs stop/ have they already stopped growing, as I havent noticed any difference. Is there something we are doing wrong? I know it is mostly down to genetics, but will over-feeding be a contributing factor, she is 7kgs, and about >12\". Obviously I dont want to starve her, and if there is nothing I can do, I can still use her as an Agility and HTM dog. Thanks x", 
    "She will only mature at 9mths.  Borders should be narrow and have a flat rib cage.  Whilst a \"blown\" rib is usually genetic, it is VERY easy with over feeding to do the same.  Likewise many bitches ribs will blow after they have had a litter.\n\nAlso, a Border should be ribbed well back, those that are shorter in the rib can give the look of a barrel shape too.",

If she looks like she has just been stripped then its most likely she has a single coat which is wrong.

    "Hi,\r\nI have been scanning through adverts in advance of my hope to buy a puppy when my husband retires this July. We currently have a working type labrador who is very into running and swimming. I would like a small dog that will keep up and enjoy the same and borders have attracted me. Is there a big difference between show and working types- as in labs. Also, is there a coat difference depending on line, or colours- I prefer to keep a coat on the short side, but would not want to compromise its weatherproof qualities.", 
    "A good Border can do both I would imagine. I'm sure Borderdawn will be along soon to advise you soon.", 
    "Hi Westie_N\n\r\nThank you for you reply. Having always had rescued labs and spaniels, terriers are new to me. Its just that my lab likes terriers and I was looking to have a puppy this time so it won't be so easy to do a compatability personality check.",

    "There should be no difference between show and working type Borders they are the same.  They are not split like in labs or Spaniels.\n\nThe coat should be double, soft undercoat, harsh topcoat.  It will require stripping as it grows thick and long.  There is no such thing as a short coated Border, only one with a very poor coat if its short all the time.\n\nIn my opinion there are no identifiable \"lines\" that are known to produce \"bad\" coats, of course there can be an odd one anywhere, but Id have to say if you got one you would be unlucky. \n\nAnything else, ask away.",

I personally don't think that Border or Bearded Collies are for first time owners as they need a lot of stimulation & education, with the added grooming for the Beardies & you really do have to groom them from day one every day as puppies & continue this throughout their lives. The modern show beardies are marginly more suitable as a pets, but they have so much more coat to keep in check.\n\nIf you do opt for either breed, then you do need to socialize & train them from the day you get them.\n\nLynne Sharpe(Brambledale)used to breed show beardies but now has gone back to the roots of modern beardies-the working type-the type we both had back in the 1970s",

Both her parents are quite hairy and we saw an older full sister who was VERY hairy.\n\r\nMop has a bit of eye, not a lot, but I think she will be quite classy.

    "Hi Mini,\n\r\nI already put a link to dogsey from my site \n\r\nI don't find Mop any different to a Border, but I particularly like free moving tough Borders which are probably closer in type to a Beardie.  When I got Mop, her breeder said that her mother at lambing time is able to catch a ewe in the middle of a field and if she breaks to the flock, she can get that one ewe back out herself, when he was describing her I thought she sounded exactly like my Ghost who is a Border, and my main lambing dog.  I have been asked many times if he has Beardie in him tho, lol.\n\r\nBeardies are generally used for rough work, and getting an outrun on them can be the hardest thing.  However my friend has had Beardies with great outruns over the years so I expect they are just all different like Borders.  Some are natural outrunners, some have to be \"made\".  Mop has a bit of natural cast so I am hopeful she will be a good outrunner.  \n\r\nI do find their attitudes slightly different, Mop in particular is really focussed on me and doesn't really bother with running around with the other dogs, she'd rather follow me around.   Also there is the Beardie grin, which is very appealing.\n\r\nI intend to run Mop in sheep dog trials if she is good enough, people have got used to my odd coloured Borders so time to shake them up again ;-) \n\r\nLaura",

    "Hi Mini,\n\r\nI don't think it's the coat so much as they are often clipped along with the sheep.  I will probably have to clip mine in the future - my Borders are bad enough when they've been in the pens all day.  Beardies are more often used in the pens than in fields or on the hill so you would be less likely to see them.  There are a lot less of them, and I think there is a bit of a prejudice against them.  People always say they couldn't stand the noise however mine aren't noisy at all, so I think it's what they are allowed to get away with rather than them being a genetically noisy breed!\n\r\nIf I ever run Mop I will get it videoed, worst case scenario I might get 250 pounds from You've Been Framed ;-)\n\r\nI've got an outtake from the training video of her, where she spots the video-er and other people standing at the gate watching, three times she looks round in complete surprise still in full flight keeping the sheep together, it's really funny.\n\r\nHas anyone seen the chap, I think he is called Colin, who does photo stories with his working beardies, I believe he used to do agility but had to stop because of health problems.

In answer to your question, my dog is still in the Netherlands for six months (staying with a friend so that she doesn't have to undergo quarantine) but by all accounts she's bright and sparky and fun and friendly, and she's being carefully socialised to meet dogs, cats, kids, etc and doing very well.

I have to admit that I was a bit discouraged by the tone of some of the more 'macho-looking' Catahoula websites in the USA, but more people who have them report their behaviour being exactly as you describe your dog. I'm really looking forward to having Rose, as everything I'm hearing from my friend in the Netherlands (where she's staying at the moment) makes me certain my experience will be the same happy one as yours.

    "I very much question the validity of DNA testing for dogs. Every breed we have began as either a local 'type' that was then standardised, or by deliberately crossing existing breeds or types, so (as you rightly point out) it is possible that your lurcher has some ancestory that is similar to whatever types or breeds went into the Catahoula.\n\r\nLooking at them - at a guess, I'd say some herding dog, some scent hound, some running dog and some bull -type..............all of which it would be quite feasible to find somewhere in a lurcher's ancestory.",

    "Abit more info on the breed....\nThe Catahoula Leopard Dog is the ultimate working dog and is said by many to be the world's most versatile breed. Catahoulas excel at herding cattle and hunting almost any type of game (including wild boar, raccoon, squirrel, bear, and deer). Catahoula Leopard Dogs can also be used for SAR and narcotics detection. They are naturally protective of their home and family, and make excellent watch/guard dogs. Catahoulas are exceptionally intelligent and loyal. However, they are also a highly energetic and very assertive breed and require an experienced owner. A working or hunting home is preferable. \n\r\nHeight: 20 - 26 inches\r\nWeight: 45 - 95 lbs. \n\r\nColors: Blue leopard, red leopard, black, red, yellow, and brindle. Tan and/or white trim may be present.\r\nCoat: Short and smooth \n\r\nTemperament: Catahoula Leopard Dogs are assertive \r\nWith Children: Good with children if raised with children \r\nWith Pets: Can be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex \n\r\nWatch-dog: Very High \r\nGuard-dog: Very High, will vigorously protect their owner and their territory.\n\r\nCare and Training: Minimal grooming. Catahoulas require a lot of exercise the minimum should be a run for a full hour daily.\r\nLearning Rate: Very High \n\r\nActivity: Very High.\r\nLiving Environment: This breed is suited for life on the farm, if the Catahoula Leopard Dog is to live in city they need an outlet for their abundant energy and workaholic personality.\n\r\nHealth Issues: Dogs with primarily white coats are prone to deafness and/or blindness\n so all in all not a good 'pet' but very high drive working dog who requires a knowledgeable owner who can cope with his needs.", 
    "Hi there \r\nI have a Catahoula who is wonderful, but as they say very full of energy. I have been trying to find another in the UK and it looks like I'm not going to have any joy. \r\nAnyone know any where in Europe?",

If not, he will eat your house. The Catahoula will not let you forget that you own a dog.\" --Don Abney\n\nThe Catahoula is a common working dog of the region and is seen on farms and ranches across North America. These dogs are outstanding tracking and hunting dogs, commonly used for hunting feral pigs, squirrel, deer, raccoon, mountain lion and black bear. They often track silently and only begin to make their distinctive baying bark, eye to eye with the prey, once it is stopped.\n\nAnd the dog I was looking for was a Karelian Bear Dog, they look nothing alike either lol",

    "CatahoulaBullTerrier said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe ADBA registers them Laura, which makes people claim they are purebred but  the fact is you could take a KC staffie and breed to a pitbull and KC reg the pups as pure staffs if you have papers for a male KC staff, infact some people did this when the DDA came in so they could \"authenticate\" their dogs if questioned. You could \"fake\" any crossbreed if you have KC papers, especially if the dogs are similar in type ie staff and pitbull.\n\r\nIf you trace back the ancestory of the APBT and pit dogs merle is NEVER mentioned, its just a recent thing, most likely to cash in on the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 appeal \n\r\nThe merle \"pits\" are absolutely gorgeous dogs and have all the attributes of a pit but I dont see why they cant just be honest and admit catahoula blood was used to introduce the merle gene instead of expecting people to be foolish enough to believe it just suddenly \"appeared\" on its own, a genetic impossibility Click to expand...\n\nI am with you on the last paragraph, tell it like it is and you always end up with more respect.  I understand the whole falsifying papers thing, I know it goes on more than people care to admit and I know personally of a few people who would be shocked to find out what dogs actually are in their KC Staffords heritage.

The man brought her and her sister to our house at 2 in the morning , said if we didn't take them he was having them put down. We found her sister a good home and kept her. She is pretty good with obedience. Abit stubborn, but likes cheese so that helps. She likes herding the kitties , she doesn't like letting them outdoors . They are not supposed to go out and she knows it. I do have pictures and as soon as I figure that part out I will share them. Rott x chow sounds like a handfull !!! Did he get long or short hair ?",

I think as long as they are gotten from a breeder who cares about the breed they are wonderful. She likes her tummy rubbed and loves being right with you. She is really calm about almost everything. I understand that if they are cuddled from the beginning then they always love it. We got her at 6 months and she still likes being picked up (53 pounds ) and put on her back for her tummy rubs and toe nail trims , foot pad trims for the hair.

  "Bloodhound": [
    "I have a question...what is a reasonable price to ask for Bloodhound puppies that are unregistered?  I have a purebred AKC registered male (liver) and suspect that my female (purebred but unregistered black and tan) may be pregnant.  I had planned to get her fixed, but she went into heat and since my boy isn't yet a year, was hoping we could prevent a pregnancy, but he apparently outsmarted us.  I could get her CKC registered, but wasn't sure if it really mattered....at the time we bought her, we weren't thinking about breeding her, so didn't get her registered, and now have lost contact with the breeder.  I am unsure of vet bills associated with having a litter, and cost to raise the litter...any advice is appreciated....and I will be getting her fixed after this, was irresponsible on our part.", 
    "Though everyone is more than welcome, this is a UK based forum, so I have no idea what price Bloodhound puppies would fetch in Canada, but would suggest that you might get approximately half of the going rate for registered puppies. However, the cost of rearing this breed is going to be quite high, unless you already have a handful of eager adopters who will take them as soon as they reach 8 - 9 weeks of age.\nIf your bitch has only recently been caught, you do have other options. I believe that pregnancy can now be averted more safely, and for a longer time than used to be possible. It might also be possible for your girl to have a gravid spay - taking the embryos away with the womb - if she is not too far gone. I think it would be well worth having a word with your vet, to first check that she definitely is pregnant, and then learn which options are available to you.",

    "So I recently got a bloodhound puppy. She is almost 4 months old. She has been very easy to potty train. I did crate training. She has learned some commands but of course is still very stubborn. With her being a puppy, she can't stay out alone with everyone at work. I don't really want to put her in a pen in the yard. I wanted to try either the \"invisible fence\" or a shock collar to teach her boundaries so she can be let out without worrying but wasn't sure if it would work since they're known for picking up scents! Opinions??", 
    "\"Invisible fences\" work in the same way as a shock collar.  Cross that \"invisible\" line and the dog gets a shock.\n\nI am sorry but shock collars, e-collars, spike collars etc are not the pleasure of the month on Breedia, which is a UK website.\n\nMay I ask why you got a puppy when she is going to stay out alone when everyone is at work?", 
    "If she has to be left outside\nHaving her in an outside kennel with comfortable sleeping quarters and enclosed run would be much safer and kinder.\nI realise most people have to work, but leaving a puppy on its own for long periods of time is not ideal as they need to be socialised, fed 3 times a day, toilet trained ect: Do you have a dog walker, any friends or neighbours who could come in and spend some with her?", 
    "Agree with the suggestions above. I see that you also have a Basset Hound. As these two breeds share similar characteristics, would you be keeping them outside together?", 
    "Hi all, new to the forum.  I own a 9 year old Bloodhound, Beula.  Love the dog but there are quirks that can try your patience.  They can be stubborn, willful and down right vindictive at times, but by the same token they are one of the most loving and affectionate dogs I have had.  Beula was a kennel dog....and not socialized much as a pup.  Even at the age of nine we are still having difficulty.  She loves children but will let you know by \"talking\" when she is uncomfortable.  She absolutely does not like adults but we are working on it.  We have been battling a nasty yeast infection in her ear that vets have not been able to get rid of so if you have a new pup or are considering getting a hound know that you must put time into their hygiene.  That being said.  I love my hound with all my heart....even when she wakes me up at 3am.  I look forward to her wrinkles, slobbers and hello bay when I come home from work everyday.", 
    "I'm glad Beula has found someone who is prepared to deal with her quirks, and care for her skin - so easily overlooked in a kennel dog. A scenthound will always be a nose on legs, so behaviour problems in this department, - usually of the head down, ears are closed nature - just have to be worked around, rather than changed.

I have read up on them and spoken to breeders but wondered if anyone owned one.\n\r\nI would probably look a bit odd walking a Basset and a Bloodhound - little and large, but I just love hounds and they look like they could be breed of dog for me in the future.\n\r\nThanks\n\r\nSarah", 
    "i think all hounds are pretty similar habit wise bloodhounds are big dogs and need a fare amount of excercise.like your bassett people assume that they lie around all day sleeping,and the survey said UHH-UHH .we considered a bloodhound ourselves but my wife found them a bit too big and have settled on a treeing walker coonhound .all hounds can be a bit tunnel visioned when something gets their attention but they are also the nicest dogs to have sat by your side.IMHO",

I know they are beset by a lot of health problems, similar to the bassets, problems with their ears, eyes, bones and confirmation and I think add giant breed problems to that, heart problems etc. I seem to recall reading an article saying their breed standard was altered recently to try to address some of these problems.. Does anyone have more information?",

He goes like crazy when he can run around on the sand or in the miles of dunes at hunstanton beach. We have learned that he always comes back to the word 'biscuit' .... being a typical greedy hound has its advantages!

Most HPR breeds are busy dogs that need as much training, mental stimulation and exercise as you can give them.  They are most definitely not breeds for couch potatoes.  Personality wise they tend to be (just to generalize here -- obviously they are all different) quite sensitive yet can be stubborn and highly strung, intelligent (too smart for their own good), biddable but can be challenging as youngsters...\n\r\nBut they are massive characters and fantastic fun if you have the time and energy (emphasis on the energy part!) to make the commitment to them.", 
    "Hi, welcome to Dogsey!\n\r\nI have a 2 year old male GSP.  He is obsessive about his ball, affectionate, energetic and very  trainable, provided he sees the relevance of what you want him to do.  He loves young children, even though I don't have any because he knows they will play with him and his ball for ages.  Like all GSPs he is prone to Separation Anxiety, although he can be left if he is with our other dog.  He needs (and gets) 2 hours of free running exercise which includes plenty of \"fetch\" and \"find it\", every day.  He has pulled some outrageous stunts to get the ball out of my pocket!\n\r\nAs long as you realise you are getting a very high energy, intelligent dog with a mischievous sense of humour you will love them.  Here's a couple of photos of my gorgeous clown.", 
    "I would say it depends what you want to do with the dog. \r\nIt seems an odd collection - Vizlas Weimies and GSPs are HPR dogs which mean they`re very active, needy and intelligent. \r\nGordon Setters can be pretty independant, and Bouviers are a herding breed. I know a couple and they are a bit bossy with other dogs.\r\nAll these breeds need good training, and a lot of ongoing work. What are you looking for?", 
    "My GSP is much better at being left than our vizsla, Vizsla's are definatly 'people dogs' they like to be with their person more than GSPs in general (altho they still like to be with ere owner) and our viz moans a lot but I  think it depends on the individual dog. \r\nGSPs can be hard to train as bred to hunt covering a lot of ground so will range far out of sight if a sent takes them there and recall/stop has not been fully taught and even if recall is taught they may still bog-off and similar with vizslas only vizzies are more sensertive and slightly more likely to want to be with you but at the same time I have heard one gundog trainer say that they are the hardest hpr breed to train and I can well believe that have got a young viz and a young GSP, right now the GSP takes more notice of commands than the viz.\r\nAll I know about setters is they can be aloof and hard to train and gordons don't tend to love every one as much as other setters like the reds/irish do (is what I've heard) so I'd really look out for temperament as I would in any breed because a large dog with an iffy temperament can be very, very hard work, a bold confident dog is what I look for.\r\nI don't know what dogs you've had or what plan you have for this dog but remember these are all big strong lively dogs that can be very hard work and often need an occupation to keep them happy.\r\nGood luck and I hope I've not repeated what every one else has said too much.\r\nBut also when training pays off these dogs can be so rewarding, and also loveable and funny.\r\nSorry I don't have any experince of herding breeds so can't help you there but remember to meet up with the breeds before you decide.", 
    "Wow, thank you for the replies!  I really do appreciate it!  \n\r\nThis is actually how I came across this website\u2026I was looking for info on Gordons!\n\r\nYes, I have owned a dog before.  My first dog, whom I trained myself (just basic commands), was a Dalmatian and she was a gorgeous dog, but like you mentioned with the other breeds, she was also very energetic.  We used to go cycling for hours and would even go swimming afterward.  I enjoyed her and she was a great companion, but that was when I was young and in school and had lots of time.  I recently got married and so my lifestyle has changed a lot.  My husband and I are missionaries and we work from home.  We also go to rural areas where there are lots of different kinds of people, and I would love it if our dog could go with.  Kids always loves dog, so this breed definitely has to get on well with all kinds of people and especially kids.\n\r\nMy husband and I both love gundogs in general, but we just don't want to get a dog that we might not ever be able to please physically.   I love training dogs and keeping them mentally stimulated so that is not one of the things I worry about.  Also, since we work from home the dog will not be alone very often.  I also love nature and being outside so playing with dogs and going for walks on our property won't be an issue.  That\u2019s what we\u2019d love to do.  It\u2019s just that I am scared to get a dog that is too highly stung and then being unable to give it the life it deserves.  We also might start a family in the next couple of years and then the possibilities of being so involved with the dog might even be slimmer.\n\r\nDo you maybe have any other dog breeds as suggestions?  We would love a dog that's clever, but it seems like they are generally the working types that's very active.  Can you maybe suggest any medium to large breed types that might fit us well?\n\r\nI actually looked at the herding breeds thinking they might be less active, especially the Bouvier (going by what I\u2019ve read), but now that might not be true, or what?  Anyone who owns a Bouvier?  Could you maybe give some advice?  I've also read on some sites that they may be aggressive and bossy.  Can\u2019t that be overcome by early socialization and firm training?\n\r\nOh, just to answer your question \u2018Labradork\u2019, some of the other dogs I've owned before (family dogs) was:\r\nGreat Danes - they were great dogs, not too clever, but they listened and responded well, but I think they might be too big for children??\r\nAlso Rough Collies.  They were great, loving, intelligent dogs.  My sister and I did agility and some training with them.  It was so much fun!\r\nAs I lived on a farm, we also had Border Collies used to herd the sheep.  How awesome to see them work...but now, even though we have a big property, we don't have work for them and I know they need something to occupy their minds.\n\r\nSo I have experienced a lot of different dog breeds, I guess it\u2019s just different now, coz I'm looking ahead...I would hate to get a dog that would not fit our future family and then have to give it away.  So I'm really struggling to make a decision.\n\r\nThanks again for your replies\u2026I will be looking into finding some less active dogs\u2026any suggestions would be appreciated!", 
    "I'd look for calm and confident dog as they tend to be less likely to be highly stung. You said if your going to have kids I've had my eye on Tollers for a while now (Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers) said to be like collies with an off switch??\r\nGood lucks it sounds like what ever dog you get is going to be quite happy with you .", 
    "nddogs said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nMy GSP is much better at being left than our vizsla, Vizsla's are definatly 'people dogs' they like to be with their person more than GSPs in general (altho they still like to be with ere owner) and our viz moans a lot but I  think it depends on the individual dog. \r\nGSPs can be hard to train as bred to hunt covering a lot of ground so will range far out of sight if a sent takes them there and recall/stop has not been fully taught and even if recall is taught they may still bog-off and similar with vizslas only vizzies are more sensertive and slightly more likely to want to be with you but at the same time I have heard one gundog trainer say that they are the hardest hpr breed to train and I can well believe that have got a young viz and a young GSP, right now the GSP takes more notice of commands than the viz.\r\nAll I know about setters is they can be aloof and hard to train and gordons don't tend to love every one as much as other setters like the reds/irish do (is what I've heard) so I'd really look out for temperament as I would in any breed because a large dog with an iffy temperament can be very, very hard work, a bold confident dog is what I look for.\r\nI don't know what dogs you've had or what plan you have for this dog but remember these are all big strong lively dogs that can be very hard work and often need an occupation to keep them happy.\r\nGood luck and I hope I've not repeated what every one else has said too much.\r\nBut also when training pays off these dogs can be so rewarding, and also loveable and funny.\r\nSorry I don't have any experince of herding breeds so can't help you there but remember to meet up with the breeds before you decide.Click to expand...\n\nThanks, appreciate the advice and will do.  I also believe that training is a must and I've also seen the results of it - an enjoyable, controllable family dog.  I really appreciate the advice about the GSP and the Vizsla as those breeds are the two I am struggling with most.  The GSP is a gorgeous dog and we love its capability as a gundog as my husband loves to hunt.  But, also, like I've said in my previous post, I do think to be fair to the dog I need to make sure that this is the breed I want.  After reading what everyone has said I do think that these dogs might be too active.  Thanks for the advice about the Gordon too.\n\r\nSmiles and sighs  \r\n(choosing a dog is not that easy after all)", 
    "If you hubby is really after a gundog to work 'Birkenwald' GSPs (google it) are in my opinion VERY VERY good gundogs and you would not find much better than them when it comes to hprs (in my opinion) as are bred not only to work to a high level but temperament / health / conformation are also VERY good (sorry I am bias as have a Birkenwald but I now wouldn't have any other gundog to 'work') but then depends what you hubby wants as they might not be ideal for every shoot as are more for rough shooting / walked up shooting. My boy is laidback, bold, loves every one (if a liitle too much ) and is not half as active in the house as the vizsla and is quite happy to lay around the house for a lot of the day. But they are too big and bouncy for young kids I would say (uk lines are often smaller).",

    "I`ve had 2 GSPs. They are wonderful dogs, but it was a very steep learning curve for me (never having had gundogs before). However, I don`t regret it - they taught me a lot. They were/are both `people` dogs. The first couldn`t be left on his own at all or he would panic. Both dogs were instinctive hunters, and displayed the same traits of quartering flushing and pointing - without any prompting on my part (both Rescues). Neither was interested in Obedience or agility. Both adored all the family and were great companions, while also being great characters.", 
    "Since becoming fashionable, alot of indiscriminate breeding of Weims has taken place. Most of them i've seen are poor examples in terms of temperament...very highly strung, sometimes even downright nasty pieces of work with other dogs. At the end of the day, these should be dogs who work alongside their owners, willing to please and also should work alongside other dogs in the field. If you were to go for a Weim, i'd be very careful where you obtain one from.\n\r\nAs with any HPR's (and spaniels I guess) they need alot of input. Leave it to it's own devices without controlling it's hunting instinct and you have a problem. A dog that runs off when it catches a whiff of game and ignores your commands is a nightmare and a risk. Birkenwalds were mentioned and believe me, these dogs are more suited to the field than a pet home so it depends what you are planning to do with your dog (I mean in terms of working drive and not general temperament).\n\r\nI've read that Bouviers are for more experienced owners as they can be willful and naturally dominant. They are used as police dogs on the continent if that tells you anything about them! (I'm not suggesting aggression BTW, just a confident, assertive disposition!)\n\r\nI know nothing about setters so will refrain from commenting!"

    "Please help.  My 1yr 3month old female bull terrier has nipped at and hurt my two little girls (now 5yr old and 3 1/2 yr old) since we have had her this past year.  When she was tiny it wasn't as big of a deal and we felt she would grow out of it.  Now however, she weighs 45lbs and she jumps up and gets their arms, legs and even face.  She doesn't do it as much when my wife and I are around.  However, if we leave her unattended she does it.  She isn't growling and being mean but instead it seems she is playing.  We have tried to keep her from doing this and we do not encourage rough play.  My wife witnessed her do the same with a neighbor's dog and my wife said it wasn't like anything she had ever seen.  It is her high prey drive I guess but I don't know what to do at this point.  We are at a point where we are probably going to have to give her away unless some kind of magic tips or training comes along.  Any ideas?", 
    "If you leave the dog unattended with the kids she jumps on them and bites them? How do you know this? And why leave a biting dog unattended with kids? Not a good idea at all. \n\nMembers here are likely mostly going to tell you to seek a \"dog behaviorist\". A term that would be laughed at by anybody in my area. But the dog does need immediate training or to be given away to a family without small children that can dedicate their time to getting rid of this annoying behavior. \n\nDoes she know basic commands? I find that when my dogs develop an annoying habit, putting them into a sit or stay can help reduce the occurrence of the behavior. They also say well placed time outs can be useful, as can be making a yelping noise when the dog bites. \n\nSwatting their nose, smacking them, aggressively shouting at them, or snatching them off roughly should be avoided. It's likely to be counter productive, especially since you are sure she is just playing.", 
    "It goes without saying that dogs (no matter how good they are) should never be left alone with young children.\n\nChildren play and the dog gets over exited which can lead to trouble, you need to teach the children to respect the dog and vice versa, there is no miracle cure, time and commitment is needed and \"Better\" management practices in the home would be the way forward and a good training club.", 
    "The dog is not attacking your children, as you so rightly point out it is play and no, pups do not grow out of it unless taught otherwise. It just then becomes an adult dog using it's adult teeth instead of it's needle like puppy teeth and thus people tend to think it isn't cute or funny anymore. Your dog isn't to know the difference though. She's been allowed to get away with the behaviour her entre life so far. \n\nTime-outs tend to work very well. Dog gets hyped up & starts nipping/getting rough - out into another room behind a door or baby gate she goes. No fuss, no shouting, just simply cease all interacting with her and remove her to the other room. This is not something you will see instant results with but with consistency & patience it does work. Question is, do you have time to train her as your last comment about having to give her away does not bode well. Training a dog is a lifetime commitment and should be a fun journey the whole family can join in with and enjoy. It should not be a burden.\n\nHave you attended training classes or looked into them? I think you'd find them very beneficial if you find the right class. Where abouts are you?", 
    "Guys/ladies - seriously?  1.  I am an attorney and use people's words against them every single day.  But please, don't read too much into the \"attacking\" in the title.  The title space does not allow me to write a paragraph to explain what is actually going on.  2.  Someone said that it goes without saying to never leave a dog, no matter how well trained, alone with your children.  This seems absurd in a sense and if that is the case, why would anyone have an animal as a pet (some as a member of the family) that you cannot trust to be around your children?  I imagine most people in this group were around dogs as children and most were not always accompanied by an adult.  3.  I know that my dog (\"Maebelle\") jumps and bites at my children when they are unattended because they tell me, because we have cameras, and because I may see it out of the window.  And when we leave them unattended, it is just for usually a minute or less.  Just long enough to run inside and grab something and come back.  Also, when I say biting, she is playing but when I child screams or tries to run, Maebelle thinks it is even more of a game.  She doesn't bite hard but her teeth are sharp and even play bites can hurt a child.  Everyone I know that has dogs and puppies are able to allow them around their children and not have any issues.  These are large and small dogs.  \n\nAdditionally, my wife believes it is Maebelle's intense prey drive.  They were in the front yard last week and a neighbor went by walking her dog.  Maebelle pulled out of her collar (was too loose) and went straight for the other dog.  She did not appear to be vicious or mad but more like she was playing/circling the other dog and would not stop. My wife and the neighbor tried to get her to stop and by the end the collar was broken and the neighbor had to carry her dog into my yard just to get Maebelle back inside the fence.  Nothing they did fazed Maebelle and it was like she had to have that dog and nothing was going to stop her.  She was biting at the dog but it was more like play than her being vicious.  My wife said that she had never seen a dog act that way and I have not seen it with her, either.  \n\nAs to a behavioral class - I got the information when she was a puppy but then the class never happened.  As far as having time to spend doing extensive training - I do not have that.  I do bring her to work with me every day and she is fine with everyone in the office.

Thank you Jackie.  I actually did try to train her the right way but I obviously did not do it the right way or enough.  Sadly, I grew up and the training a dog consisted of spanking, etc.  I have not done that with Maebelle but also haven't taken the proper steps to do it the right way.  I also purchased the book last night \"When Pigs Fly\" so hopefully that will be helpful as well.  \n\nAs far as current obedience - she will sit when told, but doesn't stay long.

That's all we were saying.Click to expand...\n\nI do want advice.  That is why I posted here.  And, perhaps I did take it as though I was being insulted by some insinuating I was not putting my children first if I was leaving a dog around them unattended.  Also, I do not know anyone here.  I know I have a few people that work in my office that would divorce their spouses before setting any rules for their pets.  As strange as that seems to me, that is the world we live in now.  Also, my girls really are not doing anything to the dog to get this behavior.  I know what you are saying and my oldest daughter would do these things to our mini dachshund when she was much younger.  That dog passed away 2 years ago.  Often my girls are doing their own thing and the dog comes up to them jumping up and biting at their arms and legs, and at face level, I am guessing seeking attention.  I have witnessed this.\n\nWhat is the best way to keep her from jumping?  I try the ignoring/turning my back, saying \"no\".  I know that popping on the nose isn't the suggested way.  Is there an effective way to do this that someone can suggest?", 
    "The thing with leaving children unattended with a dog is you do not know how the children are treating the dog. No dog should just put up with being constantly poked, prodded, jumped on, pulled around etc etc, and you'd be surprised at how many parents do think that is acceptable and how a family pet should be treated. Then lo & behold, dog finally reaches it's tether and snaps and it's a one way trip to the vets because the behaviour was so 'out of character'. Not saying your children behave in that manner at all, but you can understand why people do not advice leaving dogs & children unattended.\n\nJust by your last few posts I'd guess your dog is bored and under stimulated hence her running towards the other dog and desperately trying to initiate play and the same in regards to your children. Dogs can have all the physical exercise in the world, but they need mental exercise too which includes training sessions, looking at other ways to feed her perhaps i.e from food dispensing toys, playing impulse control exercises etc. \n\nAs you don't have time for ongoing training I'd suggest looking at rehoming her. The behaviours you listed will not improve without daily training & interaction.", 
    "Hi everyone\n\nI have owned dogs for most of my 46 years but never a Bull Terrier (I currently have an Alsation/Collie cross and a Jack Russell).\n\nWe recently had some fencing replaced and the neighbor have a Bull Terrier male as a watchdog that somehow found a gap in the fence that no human can spot and he ended up with us for the past few days. The dog fits in with the household except for a minor incident or two with the cats that got sorted out immediately by me (but mostly the cats themselves, lol). I am currently negotiating taking over the dog since he fits in and is no use as a watch dog if he's here all the time.\n\nMy question is: is there any behavior/health issues I need to be aware of?", 
    "I assume you're talking about the English Bull Terrier and not the Staffordshire?\n\nStaffies are very common round here, but I only know one English Bull Terrier.  He is absolutely gorgeous with a wonderful temperament.  I had always thought they were unreliable around other dogs, but the one I know is fine.  He is a white one, and has some sort of skin problem.  I know that there is also a problem with deafness with some, but I'm sure you would have noticed if there was any problem with yours!\n\nHopefully someone else on the forum will know more about them and will be along with their comments!", 
    "Janet, \n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nYes, I am referring to the English Bull Terrier. Staffies are very common around here as well but as you mentioned they're not the most well-mannered breed with other dogs. \n\nI noticed in several sources that they have potential hearing and skin issues but this one's hearing is apparently perfect since it came to investigate what's going if I moved close to the fence while it was still next door. I haven't noticed any skin issues yet.\n\nHe's still a young gentleman, judging by the teeth, so it's still possible to steer his behavior in the right direction if needed.\n\nBubbles (the name his current owner gave him) is black with a white ''collar''  over his front legs and shoulders and black patches over his ears and eyes with a white muzzle. I've seen some striking looking dogs before but it's by far the most attractive EBT I've seen.", 
    "He sounds very attractive so it will be nice to see some pictures of him.\n\nBut, \"Bubbles\" for a male EBT?  Sorry but that made me laugh!", 
    "He sounds a very good looking dog.  Over the years the ones I have seen have always been white or brindle - the black and white sounds very attractive.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of about the one I see on our dog walks is that his recall is not very good!  Perhaps that is just lack of training.\n\nHope you'll be able to post photos in the future!", 
    "Malka\n\nThat was exactly my first reaction: the name-giver was either very drunk or had a out-date sense of something I don't understand.\n\nIf my negotiations with the current owner goes according to plan the first thing I'm doing is changing the name to something more dignified like Zorro (because of the ear/eye patches). But any suggestions for a name would be welcome.\n\nI'll try and get some pictures today but I ask forgiveness in advance: we're in the middle of rainy season so he's not the cleanest he's ever been and, frankly a dog being a dog, likes wet earth.", 
    "Ever since I adopted my mini bullie Lia she had huge anxiety and uncomfortable while walking on those neck leach. Ever since I got this soft body adjustable harness she's been so much more happier and relaxed. I was so worried and stressed, anyone ever gone through this?

    "Have you tried getting the harness off over her head?  Or how strong it is if she decides to run fast when on leash or harness?  I have had to cut through the neck part more than once because of not being able to get it over the head of my little dog when I needed to change it for washing.  She has also torn others of the same mesh harnesses through where the D-ring fits when running out on her tether.\n\nIncidentally, those harnesses are made in China and can be bought for under $3 - postage-free, and they are shown as exactly the same pictures as on your link.", 
    "Given the tradename, I thought this post was likely to be an advertisement. I do agree with you Malka, this harness does not look strurdy enough for a muscular puppy being walked outdoors.\n\nReally cute puppy though.", 
    "Carole - I had not seen this post until early this morning which is why I had not reported it as an advertisement.  Yes, cute puppy, but harness?   I think you know of the problems I have had with harnesses for little Tikva and I am so happy to have found a lightweight four-way adjustable with four parachute clips that even I can open harness for her, and NO I will not promote from where I bought it.  I am not sure but I think that including postage it was maybe around $10 - it must be comfortable as she wears it 24/7 and apparently it is for a large dog.\n\nI measured and measured and measured her and ordered the smallest, but I still had to adjust if as tight as I could.  But it is still loose enough to be comfortable without her being able to break it or walk out of it, as she has done on various  others. And there is no way it rubs her armpits.\n\nTo be on the safe side I bought another two - different colours of course!", 
    "The big drawback with harnesses seems to be the difficulty in guessing what is a suitable type and size, and the fiddling with the straps to get the safest and most comfortable adjustment. I always used to dread selling harnesses in case the customer asked me if I could fit it for them. \nThe only competitive KC activity that allows for the use of a harness is tracking,  so for most purposes I still prefer a good quality leather collar collar and lead. Merry does wear an oversized half check collar for her breed shows - it looks like a standard show chain, but will not tighten on her neck.", 
    "The number of harnesses I went through when Pereg was growing...  do not to think about them all but they all were donated.    I thought I was happy with the Ezydog ones but found that the ComfortFlex ones were best for her.  But expensive.  As were the Ezydog ones, especially as I wanted matching collars.  But that is me.\n\nThe one Tikva now wears is ideal, which is why I bought two more!  It was not that difficult to fit on her but I did have a bit of a fight as she is a right little booga.and needs sitting on at times!   Not matching collars but same colour ones.\n\nI really like this style for ease of putting on and Tikki is happy wearing it.  It has a soft, shaped chest plate so you only really see the colour when she is doing her Meercat stand up and dance act, but as she has been wearing this [purple with black straps]  for a while now, I know how to adjust the straps [also black] on the two new ones - one sort of  camouflage navy/light blue and one sort of camo dark/light pink  before I have to chance to wash this one.  OK I am stupid but I have some sort of narrow bling collars that match...\n\nSomething tells me that I am spoiling this horrid little puppy who I love so much. And I do love her so much.", 
    "I'm happy im not the only one trying find the best collar for my pup but she seemed just sensitive when not being held and felt dragged but this helped her retain her comfort levels 24/7 during new places as when before she would do a lot of hesitation.\n\nHehe Malka your not the only one who loves to spoil their pup", 
    "I am not a fan of the harness for everyday use, and especially with large powerful dogs You are strapping yourself to the strongest part of the dog and giving them all the power, with little chance of controlling it properly.\n  I much prefer a collar\u2019 as I can maintain complete control, no matter how well trained they are, im always conscious of the unexpected.", 
    "You are 100% correct Vee, which is why it took me so long to find harnesses for Pereg and the tiddler Tikki.    Pereg was not that big at ~22 kilos - maybe a bit more and please do not  forget than I need a harness to hoik a dog up as even little 6.800 kg Tikva is for me  liks a GSD is for you. \n\nJust a collar would be no good - Tikki will not go out on any of my wheels, so she goes out on a 12 metre tether attached to her harness whenever she wants.\n\nI have no choice.", 
    "During Merry's recent bout of clipper rash, ( the vet had shaved her neck for a blood test), I had to exercise her in her tracking harness. She is a scatty madam, and it was quite a shock on the first day to realise that I had absolutely no steering. I spent the whole walk going, 'Heel, heel', - it was not very relaxing for either of us. The next day I opted for a Halti/harness combination, less freedom but greater control.\nI am sure that a more sophisticated harness would have been better, having more points of attachment, but it did provide me with an eye-opener in appreciating why some people have so much difficulty in managing their dogs.", 
    "Indeed especially bullies are strong dogs but my pups only 3 months but the harness been doing great at controlling her for now. \n\nWhen she gets bigger I just recently bought this one https://bullterrierpack.com/products/quick-control-harnesses Looks awesome and sturdy will keep you guys updated.\n\nI don't know much about computers hope you guys are ok with the link", 
    "@lana - I do not know whether you are advertising that company or not, but I think you are.  You can buy those Julius K9 harnesses for less than half that price.\n\nIncidentally, to make things clear, I donated the unwanted harnesses, they were not donated to me.\n\nIf you are advertising, which I think you are, that is not permitted on this site.",

And certainly aren't a good idea to have around cats/small animals?\r\n I can't really comment as hadn't heard it before, wasn't sure if it was just baseless prejudice or if it actually held some value. So thought i'd ask on here on the off chance there was anyone with any experience about.\r\nSaid friend is very interested in an EBT being dog number three, which i couldn't be happier about as LOVE them and their stubborness, but obviously-is researching thoroughly and can't seem to really get to the rooth of truth vs myth with this other pets situation.\r\nThanks.", 
    "Interesting question. I've known a few who have lived with other dogs..not sure about cats though. Obviously training and correct introductions and early socialisation plays an important part and maybe prey drive levels are as individual as they are with other types of dog. I have a staffie with a very high prey drive, and a Bull Lurcher with almost no prey drive, even though he is from working stock.", 
    "A friend of mine used to have the most lovely Bull terrier bitch (called Freida) who was absolutely bombproof around other dogs. She and my male Irish terrier were great friends and she also accompanied my friend when she 'house sat' for her friend and looked after their GSDs and JRTs. Really, you couldn't have wished to meet a nicer, or gentler character!\n\r\nI think she came from a breeder who had a lot of experience with the breed and she was a bitch who had finished her show career adn he was happy to find her a pet home where she would be loved and appreciated.\n\r\nMany (I'm sooo old!) years ago (around 1984) I remember seeing adverts in some of the dog papers about a kennel called Dodorum (I think!) which showed BTs with chicks hopping around their paws and the whole emphasis of their breeding programme appeared to be based on breed type and loving, gentle temperament. I have no idea what they were actually like!\n\r\nCould you find out where the BT you know comes from and perhaps jot down the names in her pedigree? If your friend goes to a few shows with BT classes, she can 'relative-spot' and talk to a few people there and do some proper, hand-on research. \n\r\nI'm sure decent, ethical BT breeders would be only too happy to help out a family of dog lovers who would (as a side-effect of owning one of their pups) show-case the BT as a lovely, sociable and good natured family dog, rather than a fashion accessory.",

    "I love EBT's too \n\r\nI'm not an owner of one myself, but as it's a bull breed you'd have to watch it around other dogs as while it may not start any fights, if it does get into one it will be capable of some serious damage. \n\r\nThat's worth bearing in mind for the obvious reason that if it does get into a fight and hurts or kills another dog, your dog may face with having to be put down - and nobody wants that kind of heart ache.\n\r\nIt's one of the reasons why I don't take my own dog on the common walks - far too many people don't put their dog on a lead or can't control or have badly behaved dogs that just lunge and go for other dogs. While Rocky doesn't do this and will generally abide by 'leave' I would just hate it if some dog came too close and they managed to tangle up into a fight. As he's a big dog, people will pre-judge him and I know all the fingers will point at him.. that's not something I would be willing to risk, hence we steer clear of all the walks where you find most of the idiot owners", 
    "thank for the reply \n\r\nyeah thats what we where thinking about as well, i know if you socialise them well they should be fine but they are still very strong and you know that if something did happen it would be pointed at the EBT (even if it wasnt its fault). \n\r\nit was going to be our 1st dog to so probably not the best breed but i definatly see one in the future along with an American Bulldog lol", 
    "Ab's are bigger - so definitely not one for new owners either \n\r\nYou are very limited when you get an bull breed, so have to be careful you don't put your dog in a position where people may point fingers at him.\n\r\nI'm lucky here in Wales, we have beautiful mountains where we rarely see anyone, and a nice dog-friendly beach separated from the non-dog one (we go in the off-peak times to avoid others)", 
    "Ab's can be huge cant they, beautiful though. i definatly agree not for 1st time owners.\n\r\nwe have had our airedale for 3 weeks now and even he is a handful so i think a bull breed would probably be that much harder. then again though every dog is defferent so you never know. \n\r\nits tough because i think most of them are great dogs, its just if something happens they tend to get the blame which kinda sucks. \n\r\nwe have some very good walking around here but there are also many dogs so no where really very quiet. ooo i would love to take mine to the beach",

To be honest she is scary looking if you didn't know that she is a big softy!\n\r\nShe loves going up to my husband and having her chin rubbed when she sees him. He is quite smitten even though she is not really his sort of dog!\n\r\nI remember the episodes of \"Dog Borstal\" when they had EBTs on as they were the cause of Mick's downfall as soooo stubborn. He actually felt really sorry for one owner who he said was a really good trainer but the dog just didn't care if she was there or not!", 
    "Hi \r\nI own 8 American Bulldogs and an english Bull Terrier. I have to say, the EBT is absolutely nuts and does what ever she wants!!! She is excellently behaved, and her temperment is outstanding but she has a mind of her own. She got attacked a few months ago by a SBT and she didn't retaliate at all, in fact she ended up in the vets having 14 stitches in her tummy from the nasty SBT who attacked her", 
    "wow thats a lot of dogs lol maybe one day for me \n\r\nmy mums partner had one when he was younger and he said they are mad, but the most lovable dogs ever. \n\r\noh no thats awful, its good she diddnt fight back but poor her having to get loads of stitches. she sounds like a really nice dog", 
    "I love EBT's and have spent alot of time around them,We used to have one to stay often and she was a real babe.I also had the pleasure of helping to rear a litter many years ago.(never known a litter so full of mischeviousness)\r\nI think the breed standard describes them very well.The girlie who i've spent most time with had a temprement that was second to none.She was steady,calm,loving,sure of herself,inquisitive,had a superior air about her,was energetic when it called for being so,couch potato at other times and was as good as gold.I've heard often that they are 'not the brighest pencils in the box' but i don't believe this for a second !!! They, imo are very bright,If it suits them to act dumb...they will,they are quite sharp and intuitive ! I think some people mistake their stuborness for being daft,dont be fooled  \r\nAs with all dogs i feel they need good leadership and consistant training.I think well adjusted/trained EBt's are great dogs  They have great character and can be real clowns,they never fail to make me chuckle.I remember one time when Alfie (my beagle) was probably around a year old and we nipped out to the shop came back and he was on top on the dining table passing down necterines to JD (bull terrier) There were necterine stones everywhere and they had eaten two punnetts (well i think she had ) !!! He was looking suitably full of guilt whilst she looked at me as if to say 'well you left them there,i am only a dog,what did you expect' lol ! We have many a funny story from her.They also like a bit of luxury and are most clever at getting the best seat in the house or whatever it is they would like....They have ways and means you know   \r\nI am very fond of EBT's  Will see if i can dig out some pics for you x", 
    "they do sound like amazing dogs, i also like the fact that they look differant. there is one down at a park near me and he is beautiful, very well behaved and just wants to play \n\r\nhaha dogs do the funniest things, i took my pup to work with me for the first time yesterday at a stables. he loved it, ran around all morning with the yards puppy. he was soo tired when we got home lol \n\r\ni would love to see some pics if you have any  thanks x",

    "Ahhhh!!! My friend is on EBT number 2.  CJ was number 1 and she was a contrary beast who hated leaving the house, they gave up trying to walk her in the end as it was pointless!  Layla is number 2 and shes delishcious! She tolerates all the attention from my boy and they wrestle for hours.  The 'bully run' is a spectacle to behold!   stubborn as mules but great sense of humour! And she loves everyone they meet but will get between my friend and a stranger if she thinks something isnt right! \n\r\nMy friends nephew had to go to the hospital the other night as they were playing with a stick and she grabbed it and bit through the skin between his thumb and for finger exposing the tendons! Oops!!! took a bit of persuading to get her to let go of the stick, poor lad   They asked how it happened at the hosp. and he said he did it on some dirty glass (he was afraid they might tell the police and they were say she had to be put down!)  She has tried to kiss it better since though     She likes to sit behind me on the chair and launch her 'attacks' on my boy from there.  He adores her, I personally think they are great dogs!",

Ive read a lot about them over the years and they are a breed i have always wangted to own but been scared off by some of the things said about them but not sure how much of it is true about a well bred EBT. I know they are stubborn and not to be trusted off lead. But are they a destructive breed in general? Ive heard they are naughty like children? Ive also heard conflicting advise about exercising some say they need lots and lots of exercise but others seem to say a 40 min walk is all they need as they are more interested in being with you doing whatever you are doing than actually walking? So anyone who know let me in on the truth please!! Just how difficult a breed are they to live with?!!

    "Hi\n\r\n6 months back I picked up a very sprightly EBT from a local rescue centre. He had been locked in a flat for 18 months, barely fed or watered, never walked, completely unsocialized etc. He was suffering with all manner of illnesses and infections, living in his own excrement etc and was considered unrehousable, owing to his wildness.\n\r\nAnyway, after working with him for up to 6 hours a day and feeding him well, he has become a real good lad. He is small for a bully at 20kilos but is an incredible athlete, so far removed from the lumbering slabs of overly-heavy-boned specimens I have seen in Britain. This got me thinking back to conversations I have had with people from Australia, Canada, S.Africa and northern India where the sleeker EBT has, and is, used for hunting wildboar, amongst millions of other things.\n\r\nNow,after looking at breeders on the net I can only find dogs which are the antithesis of athletic, with bigger guts than chests, crazily exaggerated heads etc.and it is making me very sad that, unless some people take it upon themselves to turn this fantastic breed back into the athlete it once was, we are going to have a Rugby-ball headed Bulldog that can\u00b4t even get up a flight of stairs unaided.\n\r\nBy the way, the character of the EBT still ensures that it\u00b4s my favourite breed, but I just hope that smaller, fitter examples are still being bred, like Hinks intended all those years ago. All breeds evolve, of course, but after looking at EBT pictures from a century ago I can\u00b4t see how this evolution is a positive thing.\n\r\nAnybody see fit, athletic bullies still knocking about?Know any breeders? Please PM me, if yes.\n\r\nThanks a lot\n\r\nShaun",

I bought her off someone who bred them but I wasn't able to get one the normal coloring that the siblings had since she was the last of the litter left. I'm thinking because of the coloring as well.

    "Alright guys, sorry this is a longer post but I could use some advice here. I'm looking to get an ACD and I'm curious on how well he/she would work out for me. I don't have time for a puppy but I was looking for a 1 or 2 year old. This would be my first ACD and I work 5 days a week between 40-50 hours per week as a welder. I do have an active lifestyle. I run everyday and love going out wheeling and shooting and stuff like that. (until i move out of state I am staying at my grandparents due to family medical issues). I've read that it is a terrible idea to get a ACD if your working and not home a lot and I've heard a lot of people  make it work and it works great. So, how would this work? I plan on running with him everyday (at least 3 miles), obviously obedience training every day and I would like to find some type of herding competition or rally or something like that in my area as well. My plan would be wake up for work early around 330 or 4 am, go toss the ball and get some energy out, make sure his water is alright then go to work. I'd be gone like i said 8-10 hours a day. Come home, go running, and throw a frisbee or ball for a while, do some obedience training and just hang with him for the majority of the night till bed time. If I did go anywhere I'd load him up and take him for a car ride with me. I literally want to  take this dog everywhere I go. When I'm gone at work my grandpa will probably go out there and keep him company a bit and help watch him a little (the old vet in him haha). This is the first job that i've had that wasn't a restaurant type setting so I have more freedom with him shadowing me everywhere.\n\nA bit of background on myself. I've grown up around sheep, horses, dogs, cats, cows, birds, snakes, and turtles.  My grandfather was a vet of 40 years we have owned around 15 dogs in my lifetime (I'm 20), specifically, 1 great dane, 2 cocker spaniels, 4 different labs, 1 border collie, 1 terrier, 2 different lab/dane mixes, 2 german short hairs (not including helping watch my grandpas old hunting dog and his wirehair griffon) and, 2 different beagles not to mention dog and puppy sitting for friends and family\u2026 Most of those dogs we've had from puppies and a few we rescued but ALL of them were at a decent sized yard (we didn't have all these dogs at once). I know how to train and take care of them so I'm not a novice and I have an extremely active lifestyle as far as running and working out goes. \n\nI know this breed is a very intelligent highly active breed that bonds primarily to 1 or 2 people which is just what i'm looking for, however I'm worried keeping a dog like that kenneled up for 8+ hours a day could be rough, I've heard of plenty of people doing that and they have said it works just fine. I know I couldn't sit cooped up like that for more than an hour or so myself lol.\n\nSorry it was a long post haha. Anyway, does anyone have any insight?", 
    "As with any dog a bored dog can be a destructive dog regardless of breed.\nLeaving a dog at home for 8-10 hours is not ideal, even well house trained dogs will need to go toilet & unless you have someone willing to go & let dog out throughout the day so they can go toilet & maybe take them walkies, if not them a cat will probably be better pet to have.",

Now i'm a smallish female and I have some very sensitive hands, and my puppy LOVES to use them as chew toys. Now I could understand this if she didn't have upwards of 10-15 chew toys lying around the house, but she does. Almost every time I try to pet her she has to bite my hands, and by bite I don't mean nip, I mean breaks the skins, leaves a mark bite. She hasn't really been around/ played with other dogs yet, which I do intend for her to do soon, so its pretty much only her and I that interact. I have tried the whole \"yelp/cry\" when she bites too hard method (act as a puppy being bitten would) and she seems to only become that much more aggressive by either biting harder or getting even more excited, to the point that she actually even began to hump my arm while making this \"yelp\" noise.

Also, by the time you have got her into an outside kennel, she will have forgotten any connection with the time out and the behaviour that caused it. It is only necessary to use the time out for short periods, just stopping the behaviour by closing a door between you for a minute or so is enough. Play biting is normal behaviour for young puppies, so make sure you have a selection of tough toys like tuggies and chewables.

    "Looking for some advice on my 5 month old's behaviour. My girl Frankie has been socialized well with other dogs, and children and has an excellent nature. She's got all the typical qualities of an ACD and has been super cooperative and quickly learned not to bite people. However lately she's started to target one member of the household which has caused some issues. \n\nWe live with a 14 year old boy that has a highly functioning form of Autism. I mention the disease simply because it brings a lot of emotion to our situation and changes the understanding he has with the dog.\n\nHe loves to play with her and wants her attention, and she has been very good with him up until a few weeks or so ago. She's started to growl at him when he walks by if she has a toy, and when he goes to play with her it starts well but always ends in her nipping at his face or barking at him. It's difficult to explain to him why she's doing this, and to get him to change his behaviours as well. He's used to being around dogs that tolerate him, so this is new for both of them. He tends to make funny noises, and tries to play with her when she's laying quietly. I understand that her reactions are semi expected, however she's now started to go at him when he's done nothing to start it. It's almost as if now it is a habit for her.\n\nI try my best to call her off, but I'm unsure what the best approach is when the nipping and angry barking happens.\n\nIt makes it extra hard that he takes it personally, says that he's the only one she barks at or nips at. He's getting frustrated and I don't want this negative pattern to continue. I also don't want the nipping to turn into actual biting.\n\nTo top it all off Frankie and I are currently guests in this house, in a transition period. It isn't ideal but it is what we have at the moment, so I want to make it the best experience for everyone in the house. \n\nAny advice at all would be helpful.

    "My 13 yr old daughter has been going down the street to her friends Grandfather's house watching these puppies grow up.

My beloved epi had major Grand Mal seizures but there are other types, and repetitive  behaviour is a definite sign of one or more types.  It is also a sign of the after-effects of a GM seizure, even if you have not seen the seizure itself.\n\nMy Vet never even saw my girl  having a seizure but he asked enough questions not to doubt me.  And he did not give her pheno straight away in case it was a one-off.\n\nI eventually realised she had had enough and my Vet came round at 1am on 1 April last year to give her peace.  She was 6 years and 3 months old and had had her first Grand Mal seizure on 1 April four years earlier.\n\nUnfortunately Pheno, which she had to have three times a day for the last three years as she needed a lot for her weight, could not help her.  But believe me, most vets, even a lot of canine neurologists, do not know much more than a basic blood test can tell - which will not tell if a dog is epileptic.  Even a video will not show the various epi types - unless the dog is having a major GM seizure which is unmistakable. \n\n@Azz - 1+1=2.  But here we have 3.  Firstly the behaviour.  Very common in certain types of canine epilepsy.

She calmed down once I captured and held her.\n\nI'll let the doc know about this post exchange.\n\nThank you each very muchClick to expand...\n\nI was going to reply by saying that I have a dog that used to react in the same way as your ACD, and she didn't have epilepsy but had developed  highly sensitive hearing to compensate for her being (temporarily) blind. I then remembered seeing a thread on another forum about hyper sensitive hearing in certain breeds of dog and decided to look it up.  \n\nSo here goes!  From what I read ....\n\n\"Some dogs have a genetic disposition to sound sensitivity and phobias  Certain breeds are known to be more likely to develop such sensitivity.  It is especially prevalent in herding breeds\". Now for the interesting bit .... Australian Cattle Dogs are listed as one of the breeds along with German Shepherds and Border Collies\n\nThere's not much information about it online, and maybe it's something your vet isn't aware of.  I learn about it quite by chance.\n\nHope that helps!",

However, phenobarbital is also used as a sedative for dogs and the vet did not think the dog has epilepsy (even though the owner suggested it and the vet could be wrong, they don't always make the right diagnosis).

    "Hi everybody,my claim to fame is that I have owned Borzoi since 1973 ( 37 yrs) and have run the Rescue since 1982 ( 28 yrs) .Mine have lived with a variety of other breeds,corgi,whippet,lurcher,and I had a cat for 12 years that they all (Borzoi) knew and respected.After all these years living with this lovely breed,there are still things that I am learning My old GSD who has lived with them for the last 13yrs still enjoys playing \"chase the wolf\" (him) with the girls,who adore him. If I knew how to put pictures on here I would put some of my girls,but I am an infant when it comes to computers!!!",

He's a white and silver with impeccable breeding,will probably go pretty much pure white as he gets older like his mammy.His pappy is white with fawn/tan ears.\nBoth parents champions(missus is muttering about the price of the pup not to mention flying him in when he's old enough-I haven't reminded her of that bit...)and all 4 grandparents+ all 8 ggp's serious international championships.PLUS he's pick of litter!No sure thing for show wins I know,he was 4 days old when we saw him,but it's a bloodline almost completely unknown on this side of the world.IF he turns out okay show wise he could be an interesting contribution to a small gene pool.If he doesn't he'll be a well loved addition to the household and will live his days galloping about the garden,tormenting the terriers and shoving my missus out of our bed!\nBack to the point(Sorry,we Irish have to put a story with every tale) what's the story with grooming these hairy guys for show?How many times a month do I need to bath,condition him?Brushing will happen every day,we do that with our shorthaired dogs coz they love it so much,but what extra care is needed for a coated showdog?Do borzois need protective clothes like afghans do?She Who Must Be Obeyed will be at her sewing machine immediately if they do.All I have to do is stop her putting lace and sequins on it...He's a man my Anton!",

Sounds like she is similar coloring to your boy,white with cream ears and blue on the edges. Her father is a Bobrowska,litter brother to Bobrowska Phenominan who is a Multiple Champion in Europe. As to grooming ,you need to get yourself a Mason Pearson brush and get him used to it on a daily basis,it does not break the hair. He only needs bathing when he gets really dirty or when you are showing him,and yes you can condition,but make sure you rinse him thoroughly.Always brush the coat from back to front,because that is how it grows!Hope to read more about your Anton.",

    "Hi,\r\nI would love to discuss with someone the personality traits of a Borzoi\r\nWe adopted Lottie-she was found starving, half dead on the moors.\r\nEveryone thought that she was a Saluki, however when she regained her weight after she had lived with us for 6months. She grew a long silky coat.\r\nWe were out with her and a Borzoi breeder approached us and said \"I see you have yourself a Borzoi\"\r\nWe were surprised and I mentioned that he was suggesting this because of her coat and he said that it was the shape of her back, body, feet and head that he had noticed.\r\nI checked out Borzoi info on the internet and indeed she does look similar although she does not have a Roman nose.\r\nHer ears are most definitely more Borzoi as she holds them back rather than falling straight down as a Saluki's would. She also doesn't have the really long hair on her ears like a Saluki\r\nPerhaps she is a Borzoi Saluki cross but as the Borzoi breed originated in the 1600s with crossing Saluki with Russian Hound, Borzoi's would genetically carry Saluki traits.\r\nShe is however only small-28\" to the shoulder.\r\nI know it shouldn't really matter what she is but we know so little about her anything that would help us understand her more would be great.\r\nShe has a distinctive personality,in some ways almost cat like, a definite princess and absolutely adorable\r\nCan anyone help", 
    "I am no Borzoi expert but have a friend who keeps them.  GORGEOUS but pretty aloof especially with strangers!!\r\nI have a Saluki cross and also know quite a few Salukis.\n\r\nHave you got any pics???? hint hint would love to see her!!   Well done for turning her around and giving her a lovely home x", 
    "Hi, \nThanks for your reply,I'm new to the site and not sure how to post photos-I will look into it\nI don't know about turning her around, I think she has turned us around!\nShe is not one for being told what to do\nShe just watches and in the beginning just watched and learned the behaviour of the house hold and kind of fitted in.\nI suppose she has taught us that you don't always need to be telling a dog what to do and that if you try it and there's no apparent point then your request will be ignored.\nWill try to post photo's as soon asap and further details \nThanks again\nLynne", 
    "Hi Lynne - we definitely need pics !!!!!", 
    "I too would like to see piccies \n\r\nI have always thought Borzoi's are gorgeous, but a couple of times recenly I have seen two up the fields (the first time i'd seen a Borzoi in the skin) I haven't been close to them but watched them from a distance that Zeph won't kick off, they are totally stunning!", 
    "Although i said they are aloof I know one girl and she is as soppy a hound as i have ever met....I would def steal her if i was allowed!!  \n\r\nShame Lovezois is not around to help ;-( she could have told you heaps",

    "hey I did it!!\r\nIsn't she gorgeous?\r\nShe's such a sweetheart too\n\r\nI just want to know as much about her as I can\n\r\nI don't know if part of her personality is down to what has happened to her in the past or her breed\n\r\nShe is approx 2yrs 6mnths\r\nCame to us like a skeleton and she had been in a foster home for over 2 months-so goodness knows what she was like when they found her.\r\nMust go - have just beeen found and need to take them out.\r\nWill get back to you;-)", 
    "Definitely looks like a Borzoi. How on earth can anyone mislay a borzoi? However one of their less endearing traits is to chase a moving prey and not recall under any circumstances. so the owner may no0t realise she had left the district. \nOurs was a delight and quite trainable -- won the best beginner at the local club. she lived with cats and was trained not to chase sheep. However she was a bit aloof and as she got older warned people off if they were likely to disturb her. \nRegards Louise", 
    "Oh she is beautiful.  How lucky she is to have been found before it was too late. \n\nDon't know anything about Borzoi to be honest but they are a stunning dog and I love to watch them move.", 
    "We used to show our Beagles and every time we were near the Borzoi's I always thought how stunning they were. Yours it no exception, beautiful girl.", 
    "Hi, Honey's mummy, Berger, Greyhound k, and Baranduin, and anyone else who may like to help\r\nDo you have any photos Baranduin of your Borzoi and Honey's mummy of your Saluki Cross. Would love to see them.\n\r\nI will post Photo's of when we first got Lottie home-no long silky body hair then. It grew after we had her about 6months, she'd be about 18months then! Don't suppose that is normal?\n\r\nShe has changed so much over the time that we have known her.  I don't put, own her, because I feel that she wouldn't ever like to think that she is owned, rather chooses to love us and live with us.\n\r\nWhen I used to let her off lead-she would immediately run into the bushes, not to be seen again for 2-3hrs!\r\nBut now she will stay around even if I am standing about talking.\r\nShe's still got a powerful chase instinct, but she doesn't tend to go off looking now, more if the rabbits are playing on the field or she gets a whiff of a fox or hears a cat or squirrel in the trees.\r\nShe seems quite happy to just chase the ball and she now brings it back like a proper retriever-trotting with her head held high which is just like when she brought me a squirrel-the only time she's ever caught anything.\r\nNow Leo, I don't think would ever catch anything- I used to show him bunnies and cats and tell him they were nice and not encourage his chase instinct-the tortoise at home is NICE-so he knows the word.\r\nBut when he's found a dead rabbit, then that is a prize and \r\nhe will run away until he has unfortunately eaten it, unlike lottie who brought her squirrel to us.\n\r\nShe is unlike any dog that I have ever known-she is so gentle, will always lie down and submit to other dogs even puppies of a few weeks old-although she is getting more inquisitive with pups.\r\nIf we are out and come across another dog or person that she doesn't know-she hides in the trees watching and comes quickly out when they've gone.\r\nBut once she's met them a few times she will trot over to say hello and expect a fuss from people.\n\r\nShe is magnificent when she runs fast or when kind of prancing almost like a horse with her tail in the air.\r\nBut will not join in boisterous play  with a pack of dogs that Leo will be playing with even if she knows them-she will sit apart perhaps 100yds away and watch until we move on.\n\r\nAt home she wil get up and greet anyone that she knows but will go upstairs and hide from strangers\n\r\nWe can almost get her to do as we ask but only if she knows there's a treat in it. But she is quite stubborn if she wants to be.\r\nShe just kind of fits in and does only what she thinks is necessary.\r\nShe is also a great watcher. She often will sit across from us in the evening and with a regal pose almost, with her legs over the edge of the chair (often crossed) watching us for up to half an hour.\n\r\nIf she is laid on the sofa and I want to hoover it or on the floor in the way, I will say, excuse me and she rolls on to her back, wags her tail in a flirty way and covers her eyes with her front paws, she then covers both her ears and then both her eyes again.  As if she's saying \"I can't see you and I can't hear you\"!!  Well my reaction to that is hopeless-I just can't help tickling her tummy!\r\nShe is also very cat like with her paws and is often found licking and cleaning herself-she also trims her own dew claws.\r\nShe is also very protective over her own personal space and will not tolerate Leo or us sitting next to her-she will grumble and move.  Unless she chooses to sit with you and then she will lay with her head on your lap or cuddle up to Leo - but fidget and she protests and moves\n\r\nDo you see any of these traits in your dogs?",

    "Here is my Saluki Greyhound, \n\n\n\n\n\r\nMy girl is really small, 24 tts, and is not really the general thoughts of sighthounds, she doesn't know what aloof means at all, although no dog I have had really does, Honey is different though to a lot of hounds, there are no strangers in Honey's world, there are just friends you haven't met, she also lives to please people, and will do anything for a treat, or even just a hug, she lives to be around people, and will even ignore a lot of small furries esp if you get her at the right time (she is my second sighthound who is friends with a rabbit), she does love her home comforts though, espcially food and a comfy spot to lay  Honey is very clever, and if you want to keep her out of somewhere you either have to lock the door, or even baracade it by putting a chair under the handle the other side of the door, as otherwise she will open it, she has before been put in a back garden, within two minutes she had opened up the back door, the door to the dogs room, the living room door, the two front doors and even the front gate and sat outside waiting for a walk, she does have fear aggresion, but not related to breeds in her, but she also knows what rules other dogs should follow around her even if they don't, and will tell off dogs that are humping her, or barking in her face, but will never break the skin, just get her point across. She is a very confident girl, and when she is happy prances instead of walks, which can make her look like she wants to be a dressage horse, but Honey is one of a kind, most sighthounds I have seen can be aloof, and prefer to be off chasing whatever they see (my lurcher is great at this) but Honey seems to be so different, people are better then anything else a lot of the time, and she will take instructions from anyone including children, I do very much see borzoi in your dog, I do know of a online rescue group that may be able to help ou identify your girl even more, but I would have to PM the link, and I did try but couldn't do it, I'll try again, but am not really sure how many number of posts you will need before you can recieve a private message.",

    "Thought I'd bombard you with more borzoi pics...these ones from the past.\n\r\nThis is Chaumie (1988 - 1995), the love of my life, he was a wonderful introduction to the breed winning 5 CCs and 3 RCCs. He's pictured here after winning Best in Group at Southern Counties Ch. Show \n\r\nChaumie lure coursing with Shannon (Sholwood Songbird). Shannon was gorgeous but such a frustrating dog to show as he had very set ideas about what sort of surfaces he would move on. I travelled all over the country with him for him to stand in doorways and refuse to enter halls  \n\r\nTwo babies of Chaumies, Shuggie and Millie. Chaumie has children all over the world even in Australia  \n\r\nThis is Gus, I bought him as a pet but he was made up to Champion very quickly and won many best in shows at open shows. He was the best mover I've ever seen and had the sweetest temperament \n\r\nGus' little sister Tosca came to live here and wormed her way into my heart after Chaumie went to the rainbow bridge. She became my special dog and went everywhere with me. I didn't show her much between junior and veteran but she still managed to win a CC at 8 years old, with BOB too  \n\r\nGus and Tosca...prizes for anyone guessing the date and location", 
    "Awww Jane  you knowhow I felt about Chaumie and boy did  that picture  at Southern Counties bring it all back for me.   Thanks for sharing   all these blasts from the past.  A bit sentimental over them  but it  was lovely to see them all\n\r\nThere are some recent one's of me and the boys under Dog Pictures Weekend at Ansty Hall.There are also some of them with  two of Angie's Babies   under showing Brozoi Breed Show, if you  want a peek.",

    "The history of the Borzoi  Part II\n\r\nThe revolution in Russia  in 1917 almost wiped out  the Borzoi breed.  As a symbol of Imperial power  many hounds were killed  by the Communists.  The hounds at Perchino were all shot and the Grand Duke\u2019s house was razed  to the ground for not only was the Duke a member of  the   Imperial   family but he had been Commander in Chief  of the Russian Army.  He escaped  to  spend  the rest of his days in exile in France., but  several  of the hunt servants were shotfor  the crime of caring for the Borzois.\n\r\nIn 1992 a party from the Borzoi Club visited  Perchino with  some Russian Borzoi owners and their dogs.  The photographs  they brought  back show a village only changed from the photographs in Mr Thomas\u2019 book  by years of neglect.  Ther oldest inhabitant of the village was the son of one of the huntsmen.  His father had been shot with all the hounds left on the estate .  He had believed that every  Borzoi in t5he world  had been murdered that day and wept tears of delight  at seeing the breed once again.\n\r\nNot all hounds were  shot by the revolutionaries.  In the  1950\u2019s magazine  \u201cRiders of the Wind\u201d some letters from an unnamed member of the Imperial Family  to an American Borzoi breeder were published.\n\r\nDear Madame: I have been ill  but received your letter.  I am feeling better now and will attempt to answer you.\r\nI enjoyed very much  your amusing accounttd of your experiences in , as you call it , The Dog Game.  You seem so enthused about  Borzoi that it is a pleasure  to read your letters.  You asked what happened to out Borzoi.  We destroyed them by our own hand;  they were shot and killed  and buried on our grounds.  I myself gave the   order for this to be done.    This will shock you dear lady but it was a kindness to them.  You will understand time was\r\nrunning out and we were running for our lives although we did not realise then the full scale  of the tragedy  about to be played .  I came this day to the villa in all haste to  destroy  or  salvage all that I could.  It was utmost confusion  most had fled  before me my friend asked me  about the dogs who were howling in their places I said \u2018Nothing shall be left for the Bolshevicks to burn and kill\u2019  Our horses were all gone, to the army or for food,, so after a while  go ther the dogs\u2019place and when they  see us they are quiet.  I look at them  and they  look at me and I  know that they are afraid.  Borzoi are different from other dogs, I think they know the peril before it comes.  There Borzoi are very dirty and hungary  as the cowards of servants  had not thought of them for many  days, it made me very sad.  I tell the man to lead them out to the  woods and shoot them.  I and my friend stood beside our horses and watch the man take them  from their place with rope on their necks and lead them away.  It gave me courage, dear lady, as I watch the Borzoi  walk so proudly to ttheir death in the ruins of   their world.  When all was done my friend and I went to see thast all were dead and  then they were buried where they fell.  For 200 years my family took pride in their pack of  Hunters.   I have not seen a  Borzoi since this time but I still feel affection for them;they are a proud race dear lady, a proud race.  The Borzoi of others did not fare so well  as mine, as some could not liberate them and they were left to the will of the mob.\n\r\nSome Borzoi did manage to escape the west however  :to France,, Holland and Germany in particular.  I have been told stories of a Russian lady who became a British Governess who escaped from Russia by putting on the clothes she could finishing with a large  coat and pretending  that she was just taking her Borzoi  out for some exercise.  Dr Wegner a  German breeder visited Perchino  after the Grand Duke  had left but before the Bolshevicks arrived and liberated some of the Borzois.  One of these was Asmodey Perchino a dog of vast  importance to the revival of the  breed in Europe after the First World war.\n\r\n I hope you have enjoyed  his brief History of the Borzoi courtesy of Dr Desireee Scott\u2019 in the Book of The Borzoi",

    "For those who are interested here is a little bit a about the Borzoi in Russia in the late part or the 1800's going into the early 1900's.\n\r\nIn Russia in those days each Estate had its pack of hunting hounds , when the estate was broken up so was the pack of hounds. Although the breeding of hounds was for function rather than appearance, hounds from one estate often had a uniform appearance. This was nrt only because they were related but because some huntsmen believed that certain behaviour patterns were accompanied by certain physical characteristics and bred accordingy. The number of hounds decreased and the Christopsovoy and the Gustopsovoy hounds were mated together so that once again there was only one Russian Psowaya Borzoi.\n\r\nThe best data from Russia came from the visits of the American Joseph Thomas to Russia to find hounds for his Valley Farm Kennel. The first American imports were from Britain and the first Brisish Imports did not come from the Best Russian Kennels. Queen Victoria's granddaughter was married to Tsar Nicholas II and her Daughter-in-law was a Borzoi Exhibitor, so there was easy access to dogs from the Imperial Kennel. Unfortunately these hounds were generally very poor. In fact The Tsar sent 6 Borzois over to be exhbited at Crufts in 1892, they were not very good specimens in fact the phrase used for one of them was that you could drive a bus through its front, and as for the others.......\n\r\nMr Thomas first went to Britain in his search for hounds in 1902, he inspected several kennels there and after weeks visiting every prominent breeder in England he was convinced that England was little if any better off than the United States.\n\r\nHe had seen photos taken in Russia of hounds that he called 'ancient type ' meaning the breed before the cross with the Crimnean hounds and with this picture in mind he travelled to the Imperial Kennel just outside St Petersberg at at Gatchina where there was a hunting estate. Unfortunately Mr Thomas saw only two out of eighty grown dogs theat he should have liked to possess, but what was more discouraging was the fact that no distinct type was visible. Some were well coated and other to the contrary, some had fairly good heads while others were poor types - not borzoi but greyhound. The reason for the lack of type in Britain and America here became immediately patent, as more speciments had gone to these countries from the Imperial Kennels than from any other.\n\r\nHe tavelled to Moscow , where the editor of a sporting paper happened to mention that Mr Artem Bolderoff had an excellent kennel and that the Tsar's cousin Grand Duke Nicholas also had some hounds.\n\r\nMr Thomas travelled to Tula, to the south of Moscow where the Grand Duke had his hunting Estate . He was met by Mr Dimitri Walzoff who was in charge of the kennel. Mr Thomas wrote I was not at all prepared for what I saw in those wonderful kennels. The size and evenness of type of the hounds were wonderful for any breed. Originally they were all white and grey; but have now bred white and tan, tan and black, all grey, and even black and pure white/I]\n\r\nWhen the Grand Duke put the kennels into the hands of Mr Walzoff , who had previously had his own hunt. Mr Walzoff collected together many of the remaining old hounds, from all parts of Russia, which carefully bred together the Perchino Hounds. It was possible to build up a pack of top quality hounds because of the lack of restrictions.\n\r\nThe next Kennel visited was at Woronzova where Mr Artem Bolderoff has his estate. No more hospitable welcome or charming visit could have fallen tot he lot of anyone in any Country and I shall never forget how nearly impossible it was to tear myself away after a week's stay. I obtaned some hounds better than all - in excellend English and French - a complete explanation concernng borzoihistory and breeding from that well informed fancier , rhe master of this domain of ten thousand hectares. One's first though ois why have the English and American breeders not secured specimens of these dogs and why has not more been heard of them.There are three suffering reasons answering thisquery. Primaril these wonderful kennels are very remote from the ordinary travelled route; secondly owing to the English dog quaranrtine laws, very few Borzoi have in recent years left Russia[written in 1912] and thirdly years ago when exportations did take place, this type was not fashionable. So far as I can ascertain up to the time of my trip no foreign borzoi fancier had ever visited either of these kennells.\n\r\nThe revolution of 1917 almost wiped out the Borzoi breed, but that is a story for another day. Think I have written enough for now and hope you will not find this boring.\n\r\nThis is courtesy of my friend Des Scott's book \"The Borzoi\" without whom I would not know as much a out the breed as I do now, but in comparison to Des and many others I know very little. Its like everying in life no matter how long you live you are always learning.\n\n\r\n______________",

    "It's not the easiest breed to find information on, or even find breeders for.  But we are considering a Brittany as a potential pet.  Everything I've read suggests they are a good family pet, but forum comments on various places suggest less so.\n\r\nI have been looking at characteristics and temperament as much as the primary thing, to try to match it to our circumstances. But at the same time we wouldn't want a dog that we do not like the look of. We have been looking into this over the last few weeks, and neither are we in any hurry to get one, I expect it's something we'll try to decide on over the next couple of months, we'd rather make the best choice than rush it. For example, I'm not so keen on the greyhound, despite it seeming quite ideal.\n\r\nMy partner and I have been searching for a suitable pet dog to join our family, looking through many breeds. We have no children yet, but in the future it is likely, we have 2 cats currently. It's a medium size house with a back garden, in a small town.\n\r\nAlthough we both work full time, my partner only works 5 minutes walk from home, and I also work from home approximately 1 in 5 days. So my partner is home most lunchtimes for her 1 hour lunch break. So likely we wouldn't be around for 9:00-12 and 1:00-3:30 usually. Except for the days when I work from home obviously, when I'll be around all day. I'm wondering whether that is enough, i.e. not too long a break? If that is too long, is there anything we can do that would make it possible? If not, would a dog walker be enough to make the difference?\n\r\nWe are a young active couple who are up early and exercise regularly, taking a walk ourselves after dinner most nights. Walking a dog once in the morning and once in the evening would be what we intend, above obviously spending plenty of other time with him. One thing I feel we have worked out, although maybe obvious to someone experienced, is that a puppy is not the way to go for us.\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid", 
    "Hello David\n\r\nI like Brittany's and we genuinely looked into the breed before we got our current Labrador, some 8+ years ago.  I can't say I've met loads of them as they are fairly uncommon, but like the majority of HPRs they are very active and strong willed.  Perhaps not the breed I would start with if I had never owned a dog, but I suppose if you have done your research...\n\r\nThe one thing I will say is that you will seriously struggle to find an adult in rescue.  Because there are not many of them around, you might get the odd one or two come up, but I can't imagine it would be a regular thing.\n\r\nIf you like the characteristics of gundog type breeds, there are obviously breeds that may match your needs well that come up in rescue far more.

If not, would a dog walker be enough to make the difference?\n\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavidClick to expand...\n\nI work full time and have since a few years into getting my first HPR. \n\r\nI have lived in a flat with two HPRS with a tiny unenclosed garden.\n\r\nI am now on my 5th and 6th dog; 4 of these have been HPRs.\n\r\nWe are all attracted to breeds initially by their looks and then hopefully we research them to determine if they will fit in or not.\n\r\nEG I adore the looks of several breeds, but I would never own them due to the inadvisability of letting them off a lead.  I could personally never own a dog that I could not let off the lead so I remove those dogs from my portfolio of choices.\n\r\nOn paper I am the last person on earth who should have HPRs (if you believe half the stuff that is written about certain breeds).\n\r\nIn practice I am an excellent owner, the dogs have a great home and they have been successful in their chosen fields and some of them (not all) have been superb ambassadors for the breed.\n\r\nWhat you need to know is what a Brittany was bred for, how it is likely to behave, why some end up in rescue; the best way to do this is to speak to experienced owners of MULTIPLE examples of the relevant breed.\n\r\nIt is amazing how many owners of ONE dog of ONE breed are instant experts!  \n\r\nYou do get \"atypical\" specimens of any breed.  Eg GSD that never bark, HPRS that never hunt but that is NOT how they were designed!\n\r\nyou need to be realistic about what you DO want and what you DONT want in a dog.\n\r\nIf you want a dog that hangs on your every word and has a nigh on 100% recall in all circumstances and will never chase anything then you might struggle with a Brit.\n\r\nIf you like dogs with lots of initiative, which are very energetic and can put in the time and training to ensure that it is adequately mentally and physically challenged then it may very well be the one for you.",

    "I'm also really interested in Brittanys and have looked into the breed quite a bit, I have only met one Brittany though and unfortunately she was dog aggressive and grumpy with people, and a lot smaller and more petite than I was expecting (compared to how they look in pictures).\r\nI would say though if a Greyhound suits you personality/temperament wise, then prehaps a Brittany might not, as to me they are completely different ends of the scale? :? \n\r\nAre you wanting a specific breed or have you tried going to a 'general' rescue to see if any of the dogs there suit you?",

    "DavidC said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nIt's not the easiest breed to find information on, or even find breeders for.  But we are considering a Brittany as a potential pet.  Everything I've read suggests they are a good family pet, but forum comments on various places suggest less so.\n\r\nI have been looking at characteristics and temperament as much as the primary thing, to try to match it to our circumstances. But at the same time we wouldn't want a dog that we do not like the look of. We have been looking into this over the last few weeks, and neither are we in any hurry to get one, I expect it's something we'll try to decide on over the next couple of months, we'd rather make the best choice than rush it. For example, I'm not so keen on the greyhound, despite it seeming quite ideal.\n\r\nMy partner and I have been searching for a suitable pet dog to join our family, looking through many breeds. We have no children yet, but in the future it is likely, we have 2 cats currently. It's a medium size house with a back garden, in a small town.\n\r\nAlthough we both work full time, my partner only works 5 minutes walk from home, and I also work from home approximately 1 in 5 days. So my partner is home most lunchtimes for her 1 hour lunch break. So likely we wouldn't be around for 9:00-12 and 1:00-3:30 usually. Except for the days when I work from home obviously, when I'll be around all day. I'm wondering whether that is enough, i.e. not too long a break? If that is too long, is there anything we can do that would make it possible? If not, would a dog walker be enough to make the difference?\n\r\nWe are a young active couple who are up early and exercise regularly, taking a walk ourselves after dinner most nights. Walking a dog once in the morning and once in the evening would be what we intend, above obviously spending plenty of other time with him. One thing I feel we have worked out, although maybe obvious to someone experienced, is that a puppy is not the way to go for us.\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavidClick to expand...\n\nWhy not get in touch with the people who know the breed best.\n\n\nhttp://www.brittanyclub.co.uk/\n\r\nThey will give you an honest answer to your suitability.", 
    "The Brittany Club Of Great Britain says:\n\n\nThe Brittany is primarily a hunting dog with character, stamina, speed, and great courage. \n\r\nThe Brittany is a force to be reckoned with, having the urge to hunt fixed into it's temperament. \n\r\nThe Brittany loves to be loved - but it also loves to work. They need an occupation or will readily turn into a hooligan. Almost any occupation will be taken to easily - not just shooting! \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nMaybe it's just my take on it but doesn't that sound like a dog that would need more than an hour's exercise a day....?\n\r\nIf I'm wrong I'll be happy to be corrected", 
    "From what i've seen of Brittany's (I train with a couple for starters) they are extremely hard hunters and cover ground at a considerable speed. They are strong willed and i've heard them be called \"self employed\" many times and out of the HPR group, are probably one of the most troublesome (i.e they arent as biddable as, say, a GSP or Vizsla).\n\nOne of the ones I train with is very highly strung, she literally shakes with expectation to be let off the lead to work. However, her owner has done an exceptional job with her and the control he has over his dog is brilliant (although she still will ignore some commands and go into hunting mode instead of retrieving).\n\nIt's definately a breed that needs lots of free running, lots of exercise (I dont think a walk round the local park would suffice) and a job to do. They are no couch potatoes and are quick to take advantage of a situation.\n\nPersonally, I would never suggest a Brittany to a novice dog owner or a dog owner that wasnt well versed in the characteristics of HPR's (or the training of them).\n\nThey may be small, unassuming dogs but are huge in character and determination.", 
    "Brittany's are on my list for a later date, and i have met several, however the only way i would have one is from a pup, and in your other thread you don't believe that you would be suitable for a puppy, the reason for this is all the ones i have met are hard headed, prey driven working dogs, that need to have their brain worked, that will go self employed if these needs aren't met, as well as being classic naff off artists, if not kept on top of from an early age, they are a relatively rare breed that have no working or show split, so the hunting characteristics are bred in", 
    "This is Jed my 2 yr old Brittany x, altho he's not a full brittany , he looks brittany, has a brittany coat, and what seems to be a fairly typical personality, yes he is a lunatic, and boy can he run , but the energy can be easily channeled into other things, playing and training for eg.All if the Brittanies I've met have been extremely affectionate and loving, love to be with their people, and don't like to be alone for long periods of time. Very intelligent dogs a easy to train\n\n\nThey are strong willed and i've heard them be called \"self employed\" many times and out of the HPR group, are probably one of the most troublesome (i.e they arent as biddable as, say, a GSP or Vizsla).Click to expand...\n\nThis surprised me, the ones I've met have have been anything but \r\nBut I do agree that they are very excitable, and hightly strung, and therefore if not well socialized, can be nervey.\r\nI don't have tooo many problems with Jed chasing things (and I live in an area with a lot of wildlife) and his recall is good (I was sure he got his obedience from the Brittany side and not the Setter side of him )\r\nNot a dog for the city however!"

    "The Australian Kelpie is extremely agile and light footed, capable of a lightening start and a quick dead stop. They are an outstanding shepherd dog with strong natural herding and guarding instincts. A loyal companion with an inexhaustible supply of energy and devoted to their duty. Australian Kelpies are considered the best performing medium-sized sheepdog which has made them a favorite of sheep farmers worldwide\r\nHeight: 17 - 20 inches\r\nWeight: 25 - 45 lbs.\n\r\nColors: Black, black and chestnut, red, red and chestnut, tan, dark chestnut or bluish-gray.\r\nCoat: A close outer coat and short, dense undercoat.\n\r\nTemperament: Australian Kelpies are keen, responsive, trainable.\r\nWith Children: Yes, if raised with them.\r\nWith Pets: Will herd other pets.\n\r\nWatch-dog: High\r\nGuard-dog: High, instinct to guard property is outstanding.\n\r\nCare and Exercise: The Australian Kelpie needs minimal grooming. Brush their short coat or massage them with a towel. Bathe only when necessary. Daily daily exercise is essential as the Australian Kelpie is a working breed and needs to have a job to do. Free run in an open space would be enjoyable.\r\nTraining: Puppies are calm, obedient and learn well.\r\nLearning Rate: High\n\r\nActivity: Very High\r\nLiving Environment: Not suited for city living as they need plenty of room and activity to keep them busy.\n\r\nHealth Issues: Genetic bone disorder, hip dysplasia. \n\r\nLife Span: 10 - 14 Years\r\nLitter Size: 4 - 7 \n\r\nCountry of Origin: Australia\r\nHistory: Developed in Australia Australian Kelpies are descended from the collie and possibly the dingo. They were the result of a cross between a collie from the north of England and a black and tan female from New South Wales, Australia. Officially recognized as a breed in the 1870's. In Scottish folklore a \"kelpie\" is a good water spirit in the form of a horse. The writer Robert Louis Stevenson refers to the water kelpie in his famous story \"Kidnapped\".\n\r\nClass: Herding",

    "I have a little Kelpie trivia maybe someone can help me out with.\n\nDoes anyone know what the Kelpie population was in England in the 1960's?\n\nMy grandad worked as a security gaurd at Seaforth Docks (Liverpool) and he came home one day with this big black dog, I was about 6 or 7 at the time (around 1969-1970), I think at the time, every dog I saw was either a 'mongrel' or a German Shepherd!!! So he told me this was a Kelpie and that there were only 5 in the country, my grandad had a habit of....well, he liked to tell 'interesting stories' so I have always been curious about that. Where there only a few around then or was it another one of his whoppers?\n\nThis dog was awesome, he was bigger than mentioned in the profile, Id say he must have been almost as big as a German Shepherd, not as long in the body, thinner legs and smaller ears. The funny thing was, we had a large family, I think on my moms side there are about 20 cousins and my mom had 8 brothers and sisters....apart from grandad there were only 3 of us that werent terrified of the dog, only my youngest aunt and uncle and myself were relaxed around him. My mom said her and my grandad almost had a heart attack when I first saw him, I ran in, threw my arms around him and started rolling around the floor playing with him...he was fine. Fast forward about a year or so to me being about 8, grandad lived 2 houses down from my school so my sister and me would go there after school and mom would pick us up after work, she was mad at me for something one day, she was half way up the hallway yelling at me and I gave the dog the command to 'hold' (she was extremely ticked off that grandad had told me the dogs trigger words to attack!!!) so of course, there she is, pinned against the wall by this snarling dog, he never attempted to bite her....as long as she stayed still and I did tell her that....but she muttering under her breath \"your getting a hiding for this when I get you home, your not playing out for the rest of the week....tell him to get off me\"...Im thinking...\"yeah right!!!! I might only be 8 but do I look daft\"....anyway I ran past her to the door and yelled \"out\" as I went through it, Karl (the dog) just backs off and goes into the living room, calm as anything....mom comes hurling out after me, by this time Im half way home.....she saw the funny side of it....eventually...about 10 years later \n\nThe strange thing was whoever trained him, he would only respond to the person that gave the command so when my grandad had told him 'out' he stayed where he was....he did that a couple of times. Fascinating, Ive never seen anyone train a dog to specifically do that before, Ive seen them trained to only accept food from a specific person and respond only to commands that they 'seem' to associate to uniform, like a police or army but not in a situation where the dog is off duty and is with multiple people that it knows well.\n\nGreat photos BTW.

The temprement thing is not so easy, IMO they have the potential for things like that with your dog it appears to be cats with ziggie its pups (not good not good at all), with alot of work it can become controllable but you will have to be aware of it permenantly.

She had full blood tests and a skin scrape - hair was clipped and the skin scrape and hair put in some sort of culture - and all it showed was that it was some sort of zoonotic infection which could not be identified but could not be transmitted to me, as ringworm could be.  It was definitely not fleas, or worms.  \n\nAs far as I can remember she had a week or 10 days antibiotics, plus some E.N.P. cream [Enilconazole 1%, Neomycin 2%, Prednisalone 5%] which cleared them up.  But on some rare occasions she still gets small sore-looking patches in her groin or axilla, although not spots as they were, so I always keep some of the cream here.\n\nThe antibiotics and cream are not expensive but they can only be gotten through a vet.  And I know how difficult it is to manage on a small disability pension as that is all I get, and Pereg's medication and regular blood tests cost a lot of money.\n\nBut I chose to adopt her when she was a tiny puppy [she is a mutt of no known origin] therefore it is my responsibility to do everything I can for her.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that you really need to take your little guy to a vet and have proper tests done, as nobody on the internet can diagnose what the problem might be.

Will work on getting it down.Click to expand...\n\nI am sure you will be able to do it just by slowly cutting her food down.\n\nMy dog gained 3.8kg in less than six months when first put on medication, and although it took 18 months I got her back to the 17kg she had been before starting medication.  But I did it very slowly so she did not realise that she was having less food and less food - bought a pair of electronic kitchen scales [the first scales I had ever owned!] and weighed everything.  \n\nHer weight now tends to fluctuate from just under 17kg to just over, but I did get that weight off her and so far I am managing to keep it off.  But as I say, I did it very slowly, and your girl only has a couple of pounds to lose whereas Pereg was way overweight.\n\nGood luck!",

    "Hiya\n\r\nI have been actively searching for a companion for my puppy for 3 weeks now and I have the opportunity to purchase a chinese crested.\n\r\nI have seen many pictures of her and chatted with the breeder and I am smitten however I am slightly scared that I could not offer her the best home as I have had no experience with a hairless dog and I am worried that this breed will be harder to look after than your regular hairy friend lol.\n\r\nI have read up as much as I can and I am aware that sunscreen/jumpers are a must but it is the silly things that niggle me such as... is she more likely to injure herself without fur? do hairless dogs still like to be stroked (considering it seems I would just be stroking skin?)\n\r\nThese questions may seem silly and I apologise for my naivety but I really need to be 100% certain I can offer her a perfect home. \n\r\nI will massively appreciate anyone with experience of this breed to reply with all the ins and outs of ownership.\n\r\nMany thanks, Tammy", 
    "I would honestly recommend waiting until your pup is much older. Having a companion for her may seem like a good idea but having a young puppy and another dog may prove to be a lot of trouble, regardless of breed.\nThere are many reason to wait, such as adding another dog will have a knock on effect to your training, and also your relationship with your dog.\nI'm also not sure that a CC would be the best match for a pug/french bulldog. From what I have seen from CC they seem quite chilled and gentle in comparison and I would worry that your cross breed puppy may end up causing stress or harm during rough play with a dog without fur for protection and of a smaller weight/build. Maybe I am wrong with this thought but thought I would mention my concerns for you to consider.\n\nThat said everyone is entitled to their own opinion and if you do decide to go ahead I wish you all the luck in the world and with careful introductions and supervision I like to think most dogs can become firm friends.\n\nAs for CC I think they should ideally be moisturised, and like you have said they need suncream and jumpers depending on the weather. But they still like to be stroked... :-D that made me smile", 
    "I hadn't really thought about it that way Sarahjade  I was hoping getting her a companion to actually grow up with would be a good idea as they would be like siblings. \n\r\nOh well thanks for giving me some food for thought even if its not exactly what I wanted to hear lol\n\r\nHowever if I DO decide to buy her then at least I know I can stroke her  (can't believe I asked that!) hehe",

    "I'm going to sort of hijack this thread but it is still based on CC...\nWhat are powder puffs? I quite like the temperament and size of CC, although haven't met many, but I'm not really into the hairless look. I was looking on google for pics and saw some that were powder puffs. Are these true CC or are they a random mutation or crossed with something else, they all seem to have a similar look and soooo cute!\nAny info would be great", 
    "Sorry, just been searching and think I've answered my own question...\nIs it true thought that two hairless genes are fatal? Does that mean the pup isn't born or that is dies after??? Or is that wrong?\n\n\nBoth the hairless and Powder Puff dogs are born in the same litter. Each hairless dog carries one gene for hairless and one gene for hair. Two hairless genes are fatal.Click to expand...", 
    "I think when it says that the 2 hairless genes are fatal it means that the puppy is never actually born, it just dissolves back into the Mother during pregnancy (I'm not 100% on that but Im sure I read that somewhere)", 
    "Hi \n\r\nI have two Chinese cresteds, 1 hairless and 1 powderpuff.\r\nChinese cresteds are great little dogs, I love them  They're just so full of character. They are intelligent dogs that like do be doing things, but they also are happy to sit and cuddle and laze about with you.\n\r\nYes you can stroke a hairless dog  they like it just as much as a dog with fur \n\r\nProtection wise, suncream when the sun is out so they don't burn, and moisturise them as and when they need it so they don't get dry skin. In winter they can get cold so jumper and coats are good. Asbo has 2 shirts, 2 hoody type jumper and his waterproof coat. They can be inclined to get injured they just don't have the padding  but saying that asbo is very good, he gets the odd scratch or scrape, but then he has a habit of charging through brambles an things \n\r\nOn average my dogs get an hour exercise a day, mainly off lead, but they would go for a lot longer. Asbo would go all day if you let him. He's such high energy I have to do a lot with him, he goes swimming, we do gundog retrieval work, tracking and I'm hoping to start agility with him too. \n\r\nThe difference between the powderpuff and hairless isnt just the hair and no hair. Temperament wise the hairless can be a bit more nervy, where as powderpuffs are a bit more outgoing. Hairless can have teeth trouble where as powderpuffs don't tend to. I have one of each and they're characters are completely different, but then I suppose so is every dog. \n\r\nIf you breed a hairless to powderpuff you get both puppies, but powderpuff to powderpuff you obt get powderpuff pups. It really is luck of the draw. When I bred I ended up with 4 powderpuff boys. If a puppy has a double hairless gene it gets reabsorbed and isnt born. Thats why when getting them scanned in whelp, most breeders expect less than what they get told is in the womb. It's just something that happens. \n\r\nI hope I've answered a few of your questions.  I will post pictures when I'm not on my phone. \n\r\nPersonally I would wait until your other dog is much older before you get a Chinese crested puppy, any puppy is hard work, chineses cresteds are hard puppies, daphni wasn't but asbo ran rings around me and was a right nightmare. If I was you I would enjoy the puppy you have first then consider a CC later on.", 
    "Hell all, New to this site but it looks great, \n\r\nThe thing I have to post is that I'm thinking about getting a Chinese Crested (of the Hairy Hairless type)\n\r\nJust wondered if there were any owners out there that have any tips with the breed? \n\r\nWould be great to hear from anyone with info about the breed, I've been researching them for a while and think I know a fair amount, but I like to get word from owners of the breed for a more rounded answer.

    "hi  \n\r\ni have chinese cresteds. i have a powderpuff, and a hairless, and i got them from the same breeder. i also bred my own litter this year, who all are now happy in new homes  \n\r\ni think chinese cresteds are an amazing breed and i will never be without one in my life.\n\r\nyou couldnt get more different than my two in terms of behaviour and character.\n\r\ndaphni my powderpuff is so laid back, she is definitely lazy! she is clever yet stubborn, she catches on to things quickly, but if she doesnt want to do them she wont  \r\nshe is more independent than my boy, but she does like cuddles with me, just on her terms. \r\nshe's friendly with everyone, even children despite not being brought up around them. she is my first crested and my first real dog, i love her  \n\r\nasbo my hairless is alot more hard work than what my puff is. he has such a high energy, he always needs to be doing something, he also has a really high prey drive, which i have to re-direct somewhere else. so we do gundog work, mainly retrievals at the minute, and we are hoping to start agility. \r\nhe was alot more nervous as a puppy, and needed alot of socialisation. but he is a dream now, and is the main man in my life. he loves cuddles, and will sit on you if you are still.. he doesnt care what body part, as long as he is on you, knee, feet, shoulder, stomach.. he will sit on you  \n\r\nas a breed they are cracking dogs, really intelligent, loyal and comical. i wouldnt be with out them. \r\nthey do need a bit of care regarding grooming, both varieties. puffs need combing through regularly, hairless may need moisturising, suncream on in the summer when its warm, and coats in the winter when its cold. \r\nlooking at breeders, go to one who health tests, at the very least for eye problems. i know of a couple of people who have puppies at the minute and are good, decent breeders, if you would like to know then private message me  \n\r\nnow for some pictures of my two  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nand a couple of puppy ones  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nthey arent your typical toy breed.. they arent delicate, they do have a prey drive and like to chase things, they are more like a terrier (quite normal seeing as they were bred for ratting) and i will warn you, they get dirty and muddy and role in poo just like any other dog. just to make sure you dont have a vision of fluffy elegant dogs in your head  \n\r\nhope ive helped you",

    "oooh where do i start?  \n\r\nthey are a big dog in a little dogs body  \n\r\nif not babied then they are like any other dog, love mud, love running around, daphni likes to roll in things, which i do not appreciate as she is lovely pretty and white   \n\r\nthey love a good walk and will go for miles, but they also dont mind if they cant get out, quite happy snuggling with you on the couch.\n\r\nas for DD saying they are clingy... i dont know. if i just had daph id say no they arent, however asbo will sit at the bottom of the stairs if i go to the toilet or whatever and whine for me. but he is fine if left on his own, just settles down and sleeps  \n\r\nhowling... mine have never howled. they dont do it when on their own (im filmed them) however they are vocal. when daphni gets excited she talks to me    \n\r\nskin wise.. asbo has had a few spots, which i have squeezed   but that was only for a week or so, which i just washed everyday and theyve cleared up now.\n\r\nwith strangers... daphni loves anyone and everyone  she dives to them says hello wants a fuss and will really sulk if you dont give her one!! asbo is the same, hes a bit more wary but if hugs are going hes not going to miss out! \n\r\nears.. i had quite a lot of bother with asbos but they are up now. i found taking the hair off them did the trick. they are up now  however he has a habit of now flicking the tips backwards  so may have to tape them again just to get them to stay straight  not all ears need taping though, im hoping my next one will sort the ears out itself.\n\r\nit is true you can never have one  id had daphni 2 months and i put my name down for another. i wanted it from a specific bitch so luckily he didnt arrive for another 2 years  think my nana would of gone mad otherwise  \n\r\nhealthwise they dont need tests done but id still test for PRA PLL and glaucoma.  \n\r\ndaphni has been quite fussy with her food, but i dont think this is the norm, asbo will eat anything (i mean anything, he ate half of his tooth that fell out the other day  ) so he has the nickname bin bag   \n\r\ndont think ive missed anything off",

    "well they do get a heck of a lot of socialisation i have 5 children aged between 18months and 13 who spend a lot time with them everyday and they do the school run with me in a little doggie back back until they have their last jabs so have lots of people wanting to meet them so that is probably why then i will however watch out for the issues you have mentioned arrising as i love them very much and wouldn't want to stress them at all",

    "what are you using on the skin at present?\n\r\nBlack heads can be a pain for pink skins, not something we have ever had a problem with mind. what I would advise you do is get a good exfoliating body wash/scrub for bathing and bath every other day in it until you see them clearing up. After bath and dry you should be putting on a good body cream to keep the skin moist and soft.",

Just put a little on a clean cloth and wipe over the skin.\nIt doesn't sting like most astringents and gets all the dirt and grime off.", 
    "Which type of body cream would you use on a crested?", 
    "Like what kind of moisturiser beau?\n\nI personally use Vaseline Intensive Care Moisturiser, but everyone uses different products.\n\nI just use a little after a bath or after he has been out in the sun.  I find I only have to use it when I put his skin under stress, no need to do it every day.\n\nReally, any product that moisturises, is for sensitive skin and doesn't contain oils or lanolin is good.", 
    "asbo is going through a spotty stage at the minute  mainly that bit of skin right near his back legs. his right side is worse than his left. \n\r\nim just bathing it every day at the minute with a face wash which is all natural and has aloe vera and camomile in. that seems to be doing the trick for now. \n\r\nany other tips so i can make them clear up quicker? he nibbled at a few the other day, and now they are a bit scabby so any tips would be helpful",

    "so has she got alot of hair? i wouldnt say they get cold really, although i suppose some views differ. hairless can get a bit chilly if its freezing outside, but i wouldnt worry about her getting cold, the hairless ones are very warm to the touch and often get called hot water bottles  only bother with putting a coat on her if you take her out and its raining although its up to you. as long as she isnt sleeping in a draft she wont need alot of blankets to keep warm just make sure shes comfortable.  the woman had my dog of has mainly hairless and they all go out in the garden without jackets on, and dont wear clothes in the house and do just fine. i think its just personal preferance really.  there isnt many crested people on here... i havent found any anway :-( so welcome!",

I am SO glad that I ignored this when I fell for my dog and brought him home as he is just perfect and I love having someone a bit special.

    "This is just part of a rather long article which might be of interest to some people.  \n\n\n\nCAVALIER King Charles Spaniels are making the headlines here in the UK again as owners are urged by the Kennel Club to get their dogs MRI scanned for syringomyelia and the chiari malformation (SM/CM) and screened for heart problems.\n\nThe reminder follows news of an online petition signed by nearly 2,000 people asking the KC not to register Cavalier puppies unless their parents have been screened for SM/CM and mitral valve disease (MVD).\n\nCavalier campaigner Margaret Carter, who generated the petition, said that mandatory screening and the use of existing breeding protocols to decrease incidence of the conditions were the only way to save future generations of Cavaliers from \u2018lives of increasing pain and suffering\u2019. \n\n\u201cFar fewer Cavaliers are being bred, the demand for the breed has fallen dramatically and the registration figures have halved in the last six years,\u201d she told DOG WORLD this week.\n\n\u201cSpecial measures are needed to enable the breed to survive and, despite their protests, there are no rules that make it impossible for the KC to take urgent action.\u201d\n\nThe KC responded saying that \u2018only\u2019 200 scans had been submitted since the scanning British Veterinary Association (BVA)/KC scheme for SM/CM was established in 2012 despite the fact that the KC encouraged breeders to make use of it so the results could be used to develop estimated breeding values (EBVs). These determine the genetic risk of each dog passing \u2018this complex and poorly understood condition\u2019 to its progeny.\n\nThe KC could consider making a health scheme mandatory only if the link between screening and the ability to predict and reduce future health problems was \u2018proven or precise\u2019.\nBut Mrs Carter said the KC made its own rules and could restrict registration. \n\n\u201cInstead, they are choosing to do nothing at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they will not force breeders to health check but appear to see nothing contrary in urging owners to scan and provide the information that is not forthcoming from the breeders.\u201d\n\nThe KC\u2019s health information manager Aimee Llewellyn said EBVs determined the genetic risk of a dog passing on conditions whether or not its parents had been health screened.\n\n\u201cSo it will benefit all dogs in the breed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe development of EBVs requires sufficient data being generated from health screening, which has already happened with BVA/KC hip and elbow schemes for the future benefit of the breeds concerned.\n\n\u201cThe KC can only consider making a health scheme mandatory if the disease and its inheritance are understood so that the results can be usefully used by the owner and advice on how to reduce the risk of inheritance can be given. The CM/SM test costs about \u00a3500 and is complex in inheritance so the KC needs to work collaboratively with breeders who are passionate to improve their breed\u2019s health to ensure that EBVs and more health data can be generated in the future.\u201d\n\nCM/SM and MVD were \u2018very difficult\u2019 disorders to understand which made treatment and prevention very challenging, Ms Llewellyn said.\n\n\u201cSimilarly there are some young dogs who die from heart disease and others who live a full life with a heart murmur. Our EBV projects will increase the predictability of the diseases but we urge some of the 1,500 people who have signed the petition to undertake the CM/SM scheme, which has currently only been used by 200 people, as we need much more of this data to generate the EBVs. \n\n\u201cIt is those who register with the KC who are normally the most passionate about their breed\u2019s health. While we will not force people to have their dogs screened for conditions which are still little understood, we can work collaboratively with breeders to encourage them to use the schemes available with a promise that we are as committed to understanding and preventing the health problems as they are.\u201d\n\nIn addition to requiring an understanding about the mode of inheritance, the KC can make health tests mandatory only when it officially records the results, and the breed club scheme for MVD does not fall into this category, Ms Llewellyn said.\n\n\u201cThe KC is only able to record data from a test if there is a standardised protocol and assessment and the disease and its mode of inheritance is understood so that advice on how to reduce the risk can be given,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAny tests for which data cannot be recorded but which may be related to improving health and welfare are instead made recommendations, such as the breed club scheme for MVD.\n\n\u201cThe KC Charitable Trust has invested more than \u00a330,000 on projects which will help us to improve diagnosis of CM/SM and of other ways to collect data about its prevalence, as MRI scanning is currently being underused by breeders. Similarly, we are working with the Veterinary Cardiovascular Society and the BVA to investigate heart schemes for a number of breeds which we hope will generate data that will help us to develop breeding tools and resources.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, we urge breeders and owners to health test their dogs and to complete our 2014 Pedigree Health Survey for KC-registered dogs, living or those who have died since December 31, 2004. To get a full understanding of health within the breed, we need people with dogs who have been healthy and those who have had health problems to fill in the survey. \n\n\u201cIn the last ten years the KC has registered about 90,000 Cavaliers but so far we have only had 700 surveys returned to us. We must work together if we want to improve Cavalier health for the future.\u201dClick to expand...\n\nhttp://www.bestinshowdaily.com/blog...-kc-to-require-health-tests-for-registration/", 
    "I do not know whether this should go under Discussions or General chat - and am posting it in full because I honestly do not know what to think about this story.  I just think it should be known, due to the number of dogs concerned.\n\n\n\nBREED enthusiasts in America \u2013 with the help of donations worldwide \u2013 joined forces to buy 98 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels who were being auctioned by a former breeder and exhibitor.\n\n  Terri Easterbrooks of Rock Cliff Farm, Alabama, closed her kennel \u2013 rumoured to have housed 160 dogs at one time \u2013 and put them up for sale on Saturday through South West Auction Service in Missouri.\n\n  It has been reported that offers to help Ms Easterbrooks had been rebuffed previously and that legal proceedings were exhausted.\n\n  They comprised 75 bitches and 23 dogs and many suffered from health problems, were deaf, partially sighted or blind or had hernias, and some were in whelp. They ranged in age from seven years to only a few months.\n\nSome of the dogs \u2013 all Cavaliers apart from two Cocker Spaniels \u2013 were advertised as being champions or from international champion stock, \u2018AKC registered and proven to have breeding ability\u2019. The auctioneers\u2019 advertisement claimed it was an opportunity to buy some of the best Cavaliers \u2018in the nation\u2019. \n\n  A few of the dogs are from British lines, two of them imported from the UK.\n\n  Some of the dogs were held back from auction because they were heavily in whelp, and there is to be another sale of the remainder of Ms Easterbrooks\u2019 other dogs in January so that eventually all of them will be sold. More money is needed for this \u2013 an estimated $250,000 \u2013 and fundraising has now begun again, with one person alone already donating $25,000.\n\n  When news of the auction filtered through to the Cavalier community, breed and rescue groups sprang into action, raising in the region of $300,000 in two weeks through appeals on social media from donors throughout the US and elsewhere, including the UK. On Saturday three members of Cavalier Rescue USA and attorney Angie Ingram, with $140,000 with which to buy the dogs, made a ten-hour round trip to Wheaton, Missouri. Among the other groups helping were Cavalier Rescue Trust, Lucky Start Cavalier Rescue, Treasured Pals Rescue and Small Spaniel Rescue. Transport was provided by Greater Birmingham Humane Society.\n\nThe members of Cavalier rescue began buying the dogs but by lunchtime had exhausted funds. But after pleas for help through social media were made once again, more money came in, and they were able to begin bidding for the animals again. Two were bought by others but the representatives managed to buy them back, albeit it at elevated prices. \n\n  \"We did not like the conditions the dogs were in in Alabama, but they were going to end up in a worse situation after the auction,\u201d Ms Ingram told reporters. \"We got all of them and left none behind.\n\n  \"We ran out of money by noon and there were still three hours left to outbid others who also wanted the dogs. We were in communication with everyone here in Birmingham and they put out a plea for money. Within 30 minutes, I was back in bidding again and I had a minimum of $75,000 that had been dropped in to my PayPal account.\u201d\n\nAfterwards the dogs were vetted, assessed, vaccinated, bathed and will all be neutered, and they are now all in foster care or have been adopted.\n\nONE of the British-bred dogs sold at the auction was Maggie Dawson\u2019s Pomelo Gideon whom she sold as a puppy to Terri Easterbrooks after getting references from other breeders who had supplied her with dogs.  \n\n  \"Although she had hoped to show him she never did but used him at stud,\u201d Ms Dawson said. \"She was most interested in health as I am myself so she was pleased his parents were health checked and both MRI scanned clear of the chiari malformation and syringomyelia.\n\n  \"A friend of mine sent her a pup at the same time and Ms Easterbrooks did show this one. Unfortunately, that dog died very young and I don\u2019t think we ever found out how or why. She has since sent her another one that was initially in the auction but for some reason was withdrawn. My friend has phoned and emailed but had no response from Terri so she has no idea where her girl is.\n\n  \"When I found out about the auction about three weeks ago and saw Gideon was on it, now aged seven, I was horrified. I posted on Facebook my concern and boy did it snowball. I\u2019m lucky that I have friends in America that are nothing to do with dogs, and they offered to drive from Kansas to Missouri to attend the auction on my behalf. \n\n\"I sent them \u00a31,000 in the hope it was enough to secure him. Another friend in America sent $1,000 to get Gideon released. My friends travelled to Missouri on Friday night and stayed in an hotel so they could be at the auction early to see Gideon and spend time with him.\n\n  \"They were there about 7.30am and once they had registered they went and spent time with Gideon. They were not allowed to take phones or cameras into the auction so news was sparse. She had to go out to contact me and she did when she had seen him. She was very upset. \n\n  \"I think I and hundreds of others were sitting at our computers most of Saturday waiting for news. We knew that several rescue groups were there trying to get the Cavaliers so they wouldn\u2019t end up in another puppy mill.\n\n  \"Gideon, I believe, was in a lot of four and went for $5,000. My friend was so upset that she didn\u2019t get him for me and we were both crying on the phone to each other. But we found out he had been bought by one of the rescue groups and was off to Alabama for vet check and fostering. \n\n  \"I have been in touch with them and my friends who went to the auction are going to travel, by road, a journey of over 800 miles from Kansas to Alabama to collect him when he is ready. He will be neutered and if my friends, who have fallen in love with him, decide to keep him I know he will have a safe and wonderful home. If they decide not to I will arrange to have him flown home to me.\u201dClick to expand...\n\nhttp://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.p...tm_source=Campaign Monitor&utm_term=Read more",

    "Hi I am writing this one handed cos my little bundle of joy is fast asleep on my arm lol as long as you find a reputable breeder who has all the health checks you cant go wrong with a cav they are I think one of the friendliest breeds around and they seem to recognise each other mine is as soft as anything.", 
    "Just keep the health conditions in mind.\n\nI've had two of my own, who both got heart failure, and lived to 12 years old. They were from separate breeders who both health-checked.\n\nI've also fostered six, all who have had stringomyelia or heart conditions, because the owners couldn't cope with seeing their dog in that condition, or couldn't afford the treatments.\n\nThey are darling dogs, and I love them dearly, but I wouldn't get another because of the health problems. If you didn't watch the Pedigree show a few days ago, they were covered in that due to the huge amount of health issues in the breed.", 
    "My favourite breed of dog.  I would not get another though because I'd dread the day the heart problems set in.  I've seen a few who could hardly breathe as they walked.\n\nI know now I was lucky that mine did not get it at all until she was eight yrs old and did not require any medication or show symptoms until she was 10.  She then went downhill very quickly and died a few weeks later.\n\nIt is HIGHLY unusual to come across an aggressive one. The breed is said to have no agression at all, doesn't even defend itself. That dog must have had some big problems.\n\nIf I was advising someone about them, apart from the health issues, I would say they are NOT suitable pets for someone who will be away from home for too long at a time.  They are often called the 'happy both ends' dogs, tail never stops wagging the whole time they are awake and they look 'smiley' too.  But they can soon become whiney and a bit neurotic if left alone too much.\n\nThey are companion dogs and I wouldn't have chosen one if I was not going to be home with it.  I got to the stage (by gradually increasing the time away) that I could happily leave her for say 4 hrs or so if I'd just walked her (especially as she got older and slept more). But she was never happy to be left and always behaved as if you'd left her for six months when you returned!", 
    "Just to entice you - a few of Charlie Girl when a puppy and a bit older\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nLast one taken just weeks before she died. She was the right size for a cavvy.  The breed seems to be getting bigger.  And she was never overweight.", 
    "I've never met one that had a bad bone in it's body. Lovely little dogs that are idea for pet ownership. Easy going and fun to have around.\n\nHowever, health issue abound in this breed so, as others have advised, be careful where you buy from", 
    "In my experience, they are a wondeful little breed and all I have met have had fabulous temperaments. It's just the potential health issues that make me very sad", 
    "I have a 9 week old ckcs puppy and this is my first dog too. He's a tricolour male and the sweetest little thing. He's hard work the way every puppy is regardless of breed but he's adorable friendly and playful. His mum had a fantastic temperament and even allowed me to pick him up in front of her with no problems. I got mine from an approved breeder who only breeds when he needs a new show dog. All health checked etc on both parents and grandparents etc. This doesn't mean that there wont be health issues later but at least I have the dog I want from a reputable man who first and foremost loves his dogs and who wasny in it for the money. I had to apply for a puppy and sat an interview first. I love my dog and don't know why I didnt get a ckcs sooner! But bear in mind if u get a puppy you have to train it and thus is time consuming and extremely hard work but it will be definitelu worth it when you see how much your dog loves interacting with you and hoe happy they are to just be with you.", 
    "I have a CKCS Alfie who was 5 in June, he is an absolute joy, he follows me everywhere, he loves walks, barking at big dogs was a problem, he did try to hump my Grandaughter so we had to have him castrted and had him chipped at the same time. He loves lounging around and snores like a trooper. He doesnt like his ears messed with but the groomer knows this and is really good with him. One thing (and not sure if it a common with Cavvies) he is greedy and follows the Grandchildren round because he knows the drop food, I remove him from the room if he tries to jump up. He is a good traveller and loves the car. \r\nHe is a beautiful companion and I would not be without him, I wanted a dog for so many years but whilst working I decided it wouldnt be right so as soon as I became a stay at home Grandmother(my 6 year old Grandighter lives with us for the time being) I knew I could devote more time to a dog, Emily is 6 and she loves her furry friend, they share the chair, bed,cuddles and play football together. I would recommend this breed to anyone.\n Alfie's Mum x", 
    "We're dog sitting a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel at the moment and I have to say, I'm absolutely falling in love with the breed.\n\nI always liked the breed but had never lived with one or spent a lot of time with one until now. \n\nThey seem such loveable, affectionate, friendly and happy little dogs and so easy to live with. They are just an absolute joy to have around. Well, Charlie is anyway!  \n\nI can see me owning one in the future, if I'm honest, but the health problems concerned with the breed worry me a lot.\n\nSomeone has suggested that the gene pool in the dogs in the UK is very small as many are using the same stud dogs etc and that the problems are very widespread.\n\nI don't know, which is why I'm asking. \n\nAre there more healthier Cavs outside of the UK? \n\nCould someone point me in the direction of breeders who have healthy Cavs who are free from heart problems and SM etc? Ones who do all relevant health testing.\n\nPurely for research purposes at the moment and planning for the future.\n\nThank you.",

    "The statistics quoted on PDE were from a study of dogs that either been diagnosed with SM or related to a dog with SM & the percentages quoted were of the study & not the Cavalier population as a whole.\n\nYes there are health concerns, but there are breeders out there doing their best to reduce them whilst waiting for DNA testing to become available.\n\nWe've had 7 Cavaliers since around 1995(not all owned by my family but staying with us at some time on a regular basis). 5 were closely related & 4 bred by what I later discovered were not ethical breeders, who are Championship show judges & successful exhibitors, to ourcost. Only 2 didn't make 10 years of age(& one of those died from Vaccinosis) None had the paiful symptoms of SM(even the one who was MRI scanned & affected)\n\nOur current Cavalier, Roodee, is from 2 generations of MRI scanned SM normal & 3 out of his 4 grand parents are still alive & well & also well over 10 years of age. His other grandparent was over 7 when he produced Roodee's father. Both his parents are well & he is now 3 2/2 & in perfect health. He wasn't bred by a show person, but a lady who cares for the breed & does all available health testing. The lasy who bred his mother has been in the breed for many years, she doesn't show much now as she is more into working her other dogs.\n\nYou do have to be very careful & look for a fairly open pedigree & as many as possible generations of SM scanned normal dogs as well as a full pedigree of eye & heart tested dogs. The parents should both be over 2 1/2 years of age before being bred from & the older the stud dog the better for obvious reasons, the bitch cannot of course be over 8 years of age as the KC will not usually register puppies from an older bitch.\n\nThey are almost unique amougst dog breeds as they are very much people & dog dogs, loving both equally.\n\nCavaliers outside the UK are from the same gene pool as the UK so buying in a dog from abroad doesn't really offer any real solution", 
    "That is really useful and informative information. I have to always liked CKCS's but like the orginal poster have issues and concerns with the health of the breed.  Your post is very helpful.",

    "Gosh where to begin.\n\n\n-both parents must be MRI scanned normal for SM(Sygringomyelia), have current clear heart & eye certificates(ie dated less than 12 months from the date of birth)\n-both parents must be over 2 1/2 years old & preferably the sire should be over 5 years of age\n-both parents must come from at least 5 generations of dogs with clear hearts & eyes over the age of 5 years\n-preferably both parents should have parents & G parents MRI scanned normal for SM\n-both parents & puppies must be KC registered(only way to check health checks like eyes & hearts)\n-see the mother with the puppies(sire usually will not be owned by breeder)\nDo not believe any breeder who tells you that their dogs are perfectly healthy because they are not KC registered-ALL breeding animals should be fully health tested-if you do not test you do not know, even unregistered dogs can be health tested\n-if the breeder doesn't ask you lots of indepth questions run 100 miles away from them", 
    "Thanks for that, now as a breed what are they like?", 
    "They are fab little dogs, are just perfect in most homes.\n\r\nMy boy is a dream to own, he's will do anything for me, loves everyone and not one bit hard work. They are great with other dogs and love to play with humans and dogs alike! \n\r\nThey can cope with long walks or short walks, mainly happy to curl up on someones lap.

The ears took a lot of grooming, I remember that. We used to get stopped everywhere we went because of his looks. Would love another one becuase they are fantastic easy going dogs but the health issues are a concern. Our boy died aged 7 I think. I was very young when we owned him.",

We'll generally fit in three or four walks a day, including if possible a 2.5 mile run and most evenings an hour and a bit of cycling. We like trips to the mountains for a bit of scrambling and waterfall climbing.\n\r\nDoes this sound like a lifestyle a CKC would enjoy?\n\r\nThanks in advance\n\r\nSimon", 
    "Don't know obviously why you're thinking of a ckc if you know a breeder or have seen one in rescue then you might have your heart set on one but that sounds more like a springer lifestyle than a ckc to be honest. I've never owned a ckc but have quite a bit of experience with springers and cockers, a ckc would propably go and go but be knackered the rest of the time whereas springers, and working cockers actually, will just carry on and on and on.... You say your existing dog is exercise mad which will be the breed so another high octane breed would easily be able to keep up, a springer would thrive on all that exercise. Other people will have different opinions of course and there might be people that own ckc on here that can disprove all the things I've said about them!",

    "my CKC x could run and play all day, she loves it.",

    "Well thanks everyone for your help and advice, we've replaced the cycling in our fitness regime with a nice long walk to make things a little more cav friendly, it also means we have more time to socialize with dogs and owners  \n\r\nWe've also been looking at rescue places etc and have managed to find a new addition to the family...............allow me to introduce Olly  He's 6 months old and is a super active bundle of fun. He needs a little bit of training, which should keep us all busy!\n\r\nAnyway time for some pics of the little chap!\n\n\n\n\r\nAnd here he is with our other dog, Sophie who he is maybe a little TOO fond of!!",

    "Well done on rescuing a Cavalier.\n\r\nPlease remember that he is still a puppy when going walking & keep to the 5 minutes per month of age rule. He will be quite willing to go forever, but could end up with joint & growth problems if he has too much walking etc before he has finished growing\n\r\nMy 20 month Cavalier loves my BC puppy & plays for ages with her & my Mr Wu(who is my next youngest BC)", 
    "Both your dogs are lovely. Congrats on your new addition to the family, sounds like a great lifestyle as long as you take it easy while little one is still young",

Why didn't someone PM me?????\n\nFirst SLB, of course you have a perfect right not to like any breed of dog but what's not to like about Affens?     \n\nSo if I am to make any headway in converting you I need to know what it is about them you object to? As you say you are attracted to some of the less obviously attractive breeds but is it their looks? Or size? Or temperament? \n\nSo I shall start with what I like about them...\n\nthey are small, but 'cobby', \nfriendly but not obsequious, \nbusy but not manic, \nfeisty but not too 'terrierish', \nunusual but not inbred\n\n...and for me the looks tick all the boxes, black, scruffy, cutest face in the world but with a breed standard that states they must not have breathing difficulties. And finally I found a breeder who lives relatively nearby, breeds for health and temperament primarily and is a lovely person!\n\nNot saying my boys are perfect, Gozo is not stocky enough, he is the offspring of a dog imported from the US to widen the gene pool so threw out a couple of surprises.  And Enzo has a bit of a Napoleon complex that we are working on!  \n\nHave I made any progress? Anything else I need to work on to convince you? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI forgot to mention trainable, Enzo is doing really well at agility and we hope to enter some competitions next year, he's not the fastest dog but only goes wrong if I handle wrong - an unfortunately frequent occurrence!    \n\nETA I don't understand why they are not more common?\n\nJ.",

He even plays with Dennis, our ferret, for a couple of hours every night - something which I couldn't trust either of my other dogs to do.\n\r\nSo, basically I couldn't choose a favourite between them, but think both breeds will always be a member of my family from now on (even though years ago I swore I would never have a 'poncy poodle' - thought I was a bull terrier person through and through - just shows you how wrong you can be!\n\r\nGood luck with your Affen, you lucky thing - I would love another one - I know you will love it.

    "Hello!\n\nI have an 8 month old, male tricolour rough collie puppy.  \n\nHe has a tendency to get matts right behind his ears, and it seems that every time I brush them out, they're back within 24 hours.  It takes a long time to brush them out and he doesn't enjoy this.  Does anyone have a specific product they'd recommend to help with this?  Could anyone possible recommend a detangling spray or other product that makes grooming a little easier for us both?", 
    "When I had Cavaliers I found Johnson's Anti Tangle spray worked really well for this problem. On the downside, though it smells pleasant, it is perhaps a little heavy on the perfume. It should not be used before showing in breed classes, as the base is a very light oil, and KC regs. only permit the use of plain water as a coat dressing.", 
    "Removing mats can be an extremely uncomfortable process for your dog. Before you begin, you can spray your dog's coat with a detangling spray. Detangling sprays may not always work. Use a slicker brush to locate the mats. Mats are often found around the ears, below the neck, under the belly, and along the back legs. Take the base of the mat into your hand, at the section closest to your dog's skin. When you find mats, start to untangle them with your fingers. Cornstarch is often used as a dematting aid. You can also try spraying a light coat of coconut oil onto each mat and then combing out. When the mat is very tangled and your fingers aren't working, try picking through it with a comb or other dematting tool instead of just combing through it. Once you separate as much of the mat as you can with your fingers, run through the mat with a dematting comb. If the mat is bad, comb through from the tip to the base to lessen the strain on your dog's hair. Make sure to keep a hold on the mat so you don't pull at your dog's skin. If the mat doesn't come out after using your fingers and a comb or brush, try a mat rake. Once you have gotten the mat loosened enough, use your slicker brush to finish brushing the mat. If the mat won't break apart or loosen with your fingers, the rake, or comb, try a mat splitter. Use a sawing motion when you cut the hair. Be careful using a mat splitter. When everything else fails, try clippers. Make sure to watch carefully as you trim away the mat. If the mats are too difficult to remove, or your dog is not cooperating, take your dog to the groomers. Though some people suggest using scissors, you should refrain from using them on your pet. If you are uncomfortable using these sharp objects on your dog, then take him to a professional.", 
    "My dog doesn't have so long hair and we don't have such a big problem in removing mats, cause she doesn't have them at all. But I heard that detangling sprays are good, can't recommend you anything specific. My neighbours have a labrador and they use The Rosmax Dematting Tool, it's quite effective as I read its pros here https://thepetsmaster.com/best-dog-dematting-tool/. I think you can't get rid of tangles and mats without a good tool. Hope you'll find a solution. Good luck!",

    "Hi there!  We just got ourselves a rough collie puppy.  We've had him for three weeks, he is 13 weeks.  His name is Louie \n\nWe're really into training and behavior, we do several short training sessions with him every day.  I think that overall we are doing a good job with him, but there is just SO much info about dog training, and we feel very overwhelmed, and unsure of what methods are the best for our dog.\n\nI've read a couple of books on Collies, and looked through many Collie-specific websites.  I keep reading that they are very sensitive, and that they respond to a gentler training approach with lots of positive reinforcement.  \n\nWe take him to a weekly puppy obedience school with other dogs where they socialize, then you walk in a circle, sit the dogs, walk some more, more on recall, work on leave it, etc.  They are adamant that I be more firm when trying to get his attention.  If he's doing something bad I should say \"HEY!\".  I need to be less gentle.\n\nAs you can imagine I have no idea what the heck I should be doing, I'm getting so much conflicting information.  I'm going to list what our methods have been with training and obedience. It would be SO awesome if anybody has any criticisms or suggestions.\n\nWe worked on sit and potty training right away.  He got potty training in about a week.  He still has pee accidents sometimes, but we think that it's because he just can't hold it.  He  either goes to the door or we take him out before he gets a chance.\n\nWe try to keep training sessions short.  He gets sit, but if I try to make him sit too many times he starts barking, like, \"No!  I just did that!\"  This does make it hard to train commands that require the dog to be sitting first.  Also, the puppy class has us constantly sit the dog, so eventually he stops wanting to sit, but it's even worse because he's in a crazy, loud, smelly room with other dogs.\n\nHe can be lured into a \"down\" position once he's sitting.\n\nI will hold a treat in hand and command \"leave it\" as he licks my hand.  He'll stop then he gets the treat.\n\nI train \"watch me\"  I say \"watch me\" and if he looks at me he gets a treat.\n\nFor stay I have him sit, then I back away saying stay with my palm out, he can do that for a pretty long time, maybe 6 steps back.  The puppy class people say I need to be turning my back for stay and not looking at him, which sounds great but obviously he won't do that.  I'm going to try to work on turning my back though.\n\nFor recall my girlfriend and we will play \"puppy tennis\".  I'll call him then he gets a treat, then she calls him and he gets a treat, slowly increasing the distance.  The puppy class people say I need to have him come when he can't see me, which I agree with.  I guess I'm just slowly building towards that.\n\nOutside his recall is pretty poor.  After he goes potty he just wants to stay outside and I'm there by the door, \"Louie come!\"  whistling, trying to get him to come back in.  I'd say he comes 40% of the time.  \n\nI'll hold out my hand and say \"touch\".  If he touches with his nose or licks then he gets a treat.  I'll slowly increase the intensity of the stimulation, trying to get him to let me pet him without nipping at me.  If he uses his teeth at all (usually he's gentle with his teeth) he doesn't get the treat.  \n\nHe does get bitey when he gets worked up.  The puppy training people say to scream \"OUCH!\" and act really hurt, then bring the hand back in and see if he bites again.  Three times then he gets a time out.  I get why they want us to do this, but he really does not seem to respond to this at all.  It just doesn't work.  We've tried yelling, or stearnly saying \"NO BITE\" but this can make him defiant.  So far we've had the best luck with \"No bite\", calm, but firm.  Also we might use \"Off\" but I think we've decided that \"Off\" should be used when he jumps on us.  Honestly if he's bitey and we can't get him to settle down most of the time we put him on the other side of a gate, he whines a bit and watches us, calms down.  This is one area where I could really use advice, we REALLY REALLY don't want him to be getting bitey and playing to rough onces he's 60-80 pounds!\n\nHe's not too good on walking on a leash.  I will leash him, he gets a treat.  Then we'll walk around the house and I try to lure him with a toy or treats.  I'll say \"heel\" and try to get him into heel position.  He gets a treat when he's in heel position.  Sometimes I'll try the same thing but but outside where all he wants to do is sniff around.\n\nSometimes outside I will try to get him to follow me and get into heel position without the leash.  I'll use treats to lure him for a bit, then I'll leave him alone, then some more heel and treats.  \n\nHe does seem to be getting better when he's on the leash, but he still puts the breaks on A LOT when he's on the leash and I doing a lot of \"This way!\"  \"Come!\"  \"Heel!\" .  I am always sure to be the first one out the door, and lately I've been trying to get him to sit before he can go outside.\n\nThe puppy class people are very adamant that we issue commands only once.  But this does not work!  If I issue a command and he does not obey, do I just stand there, defeated?  When do I try the command again?  Surely there is some leeway here?  Sometimes he responds right away, but sometimes there are too many distractions.  I'll use watch me to get his attention first, but even \"watch me\" usually must be repeated before he'll look.  Am I training him to ignore me?  Or is this normal?  \n\nWe have two cats and sometimes he'll want to play with them, chase them,bark at them.  The cats are getting less afraid of him and they'll take a swipe at him and he'll back off.  We're hoping that they just kind of learn to get along together like our pets always did growing up, but should we maybe be doing something specific to facilitate this?\n\nOverall I'd say his biggest problems are coming when we call, and settling down when he starts to play too rough.  Also walking on leash without putting on the brakes constantly would be a huge plus.  He does start barking at neighbor dogs through the fence, we will socialize him with all of them eventually (except one which is a mean and unfriendly pit bull).  I usually use watch me and can get him away from the fence.\n\nSeriously big thanks to anybody who takes to time to read this and has any advice or wisdom.  Thanks so much.", 
    "You are doing brilliantly well. Puppy classes where the pups are worked for the solid hour really are too long. The pups get bored. \n\nForget advice about getting tough. Not needed. Think how far you have come with your youngster and you will see that your own approach is working.\n\nAt 13 weeks, I'd usually advice training sessions of no longer than 5 minutes and keep what you do varied - especially with a collie \n\nWhen I ran training classes, the dogs worked one at a time with one or two group participation things. That way, the dogs got rest between working to keep up their interest and owners still learned because watching others shows where things go right and where they go wrong.\n\nKeep it up with your pup. He sounds lovely.", 
    "I can't believe that you are attempting to so much after just having your puppy three weeks!\nCollies can be sensitive, so trust your own judgment, - if you think that he is looking worried, don't push it, training should be a happy event for both of you.\nFor your stays, you could try standing sideways on. It distinguishes it from a recall for the puppy, and adds an intermediate stage to turning your back on them.\nKeep your lead training sessions brief until he is walking happily. Don't be afraid to lure with something really tasty, (sliced hot dog, cheese, baked liver), you can always fade the lure later.", 
    "Thanks for the input ya'll!  Good to know that we're on the right track, and to get some consistent feedback.\n\nWe've already started incorporating the sideways stay",

The grooming is not too bad if you can keep on top of it - but they do shed, shed, shed.   I have also had a very large sheltie (who was more like an old fashioned collie) and he too was a lovely dog.  He was very big for a sheltie - more the size of a small rough, but perfectly put together, with the typical soft sheltie face.  He lived until he was nearly 18 years old and my children grew up with him.  Both breeds are very gentle and loyal towards their own family, although not too demonstrative to outsiders.

Unfortunately I have to travel 30mins 3 times a week then back at night and I live in North Wales near Snowdon and the roads are quite winding,  its a long journey for her. My other dog is an ex show dog and I have her in the car with us as I thought it would help Bonnie get some confidence. But  alas poor Maddison gets covered in drool lol. I did try her in a crate and covered it for a few days, but thought it wasn't working. However I think I will put her back in it again and cover it, Also go back to the stugeron and give her tablets at night as you suggest and then in morning. She was 12,85 kg when last weighed a couple of weeks ago so not sure if one tablet will be enough. But I guess its just a matter of waiting to see how see goes over time,", 
    "If Stugeron doesn't work, have you tried Kwells, which are a different type of drug. The downside is that they can cause drowsiness - so not advisable if you are showing. Could you try letting her sit in different areas of the car - or next to a passenger? I was a car sick child, and know that I felt better in the front. Maybe not ideal for a dog, (even with a seat belt, there is an air bag risk), but I think I would try anything to get her started enjoying outings. Do you find using the radio is any help? Keep trying, I am sure you will crack it eventually.",

    "Hi, I am new here.  I have a nine year old rough coat Collie.  He has had many health issues since a puppy starting with constant skin infections.  The latest problem is that his tail is leaking fluid.  This leaking is under his tail near the base of his body.  Seems I have stumped my Vet.  He has tried three different antibiotics, all of which did not work.  He has presently prescribed a fourth one.  I have had three Vets examine my Collie.  Also had his anal glands checked and they are fine.  Has anyone ever heard of this condition?  I have to wash that area every day because it becomes constantly wet and smells. I have put tissue or paper towels under his tail to try to keep it dry but they must be changed frequently during the day because they become soaked.  If anyone has any info on this, please let me know.  Thank you.", 
    "Hello. I absolutely adore Rough Collies! To prevent help skin infections, give the dog a teaspoon of honey with each meal. What you are describing sounds like an anal sac disorder. Is he scooting? I would try to stay away from antibiotics. I will not use them or give them to my dogs because they absolutely destroy the body. I don't think three vets could miss an anal sac problem. Is it possible your dog is wetting himself? Lymphorrhea is the only other possible explanation I can think of. Lymphorrhea is the leakage, or weeping, of lymph fluid through the skin surface. Large beads of fluid appear on the skin and trickle from the affected areas. While I have never heard of this in a dog, it is certainly possible.\n\nhttp://www.lymphedemapeople.com/thesite/lymphedema_lymphorrhea.htm", 
    "I'd not heard of lymphedema so looked on google\n\nhttps://www.vetinfo.com/lymphedema-in-dogs.html\n\nI suppose it's possible especially if you have noticed any swelling as well as the wetness? Certainly one to mention to your vet for his/her opinion", 
    "Apparently dogs can have it! I would definitely mention this to your veterinarian and see what can be done.", 
    "I am not claiming any expertise beyond the fact that I have lived with lymphoedema, (sp. UK), for the last five years, subsequent to breast surgery. To the best of my knowledge, the area would have to be markedly swollen and congested, before infection, injury, or sheer pressure could cause the leakage of lymphatic fluid. \n\nI have had a veteran lurcher which needed a tail amputation due to a crop of very irritating dermoid cysts, and a obedience classmate had to have the tail of her veteran Beardie amputated just two weeks ago. Her vet had suspected a malignancy, but happily it has tested as benign. Is there a possibility that it could be wet because he has been chewing at it?", 
    "Thank you all for responding.  I am taking my Collie, Jake to the Vet tomorrow.  I will mention the lymphoedema to him and see what he says. Wow, that sure sounds like what Jake has.   At the moment, the new antibiotic is called Primor.  Jake has been on Cephalexin, Ciprofloxacin, and Amoxicillian, and Prednisone since May, 2016.  Jake has not chewed that area.  Anal sacs were checked. Also, I think his tail looks swollen in that area.  \nAs for his skin infections, my Vet recommended Apoquel.  It did stop almost all these infections.  Every once in a while he will get a flair up.  Tomorrow the Vet wants to try a shot instead of giving these pills daily.  Jake must be on Apoquel for the rest of his life. Right now it costs me $104 per month.  He really hasn't been a healthy dog since day one.  He is also on thyroid medication and rimadyl.  I swear I'm at the Vet every single month.", 
    "I've done some more research on the subject. Lymphedema is a medical in which localized fluid retention and tissue swelling are caused by a compromised lymphatic system. Congenital forms of the disease has been reported in bulldogs and poodles, as well as Labrador retrievers and Old English sheepdogs. The fluid accumulation (edema) is usually not painful and pits; that is, a depression develops if the skin is pushed with a finger (which eventually disappears if fibrosis occurs). Hereditary and congenital (present at birth) forms of lymphedema are caused by malformations of the lymphatic system, such as aplasia, valvular incompetence, and lymph node fibrosis. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog\u2019s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian.",

While we do know how to care for this breed (grooming, grooming and more grooming) we have never had to have one on a weight loss diet before. She is currently being fed on Pedigree Vital, which I have heard negative things about, with added treats and leftover human food including toast, fish, meat, chicken, omelette and cheese. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice on how best to try and bring her weight down without pushing her too far too fast. We will be taking her to our vet in a couple of weeks but we were hoping to get her off to a good start from day one. \n\nThanks", 
    "Hello Helen\n\nI have no idea what Pedigree Vital is but first of all I would try to find a more suitable food - have a look at  http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/ to compare it with a possible food more ideal for her.  Ignore how much they say on the can or on the bag if it is kibble - most of them are wildly inaccurate and say you should feed X amount when the dog only needs x amount.\n\nThen cut out the human extra food and treats.\n\nLess food, less treats, more exercise and no more left-over human food.  That is what I would advise.   Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than I will be along soon - I am a raw feeder so do not know anything about pre-prepared dog food, canned or kibble.\n\nIn the meantime, it is so good of you to have taken this girl on, and", 
    "Weigh the food. It's surprising how the amount given can creep up when dishing it up 'by eye'. \n\nIf you need to cut the amount, do it slowly so that her stomach has time to adjust to the new amount. If giving her bits of human food (and I'm very guilty of this), make sure the amount is small. If you want to wean her off it, give her bits of kibble when you would normally give her a treat 'from your plate' and take the amount off her next meal.\n\nWalks are the best way to exercise. Go at a speed she can cope with and gradually up the pace as the weeks pass.\n\nGood luck with your new girl", 
    "Afraid im not a fan of pedigree feeds and vital has a bad scoring,http://www.allaboutdogfood.co.uk/dog-food-reviews/0053/pedigree-adult-vital\n\n  I would look for a grain free food, which will have fewer calories, if cutting down her food I would split it into 2/3 meals per day that way she wont feel so hungry.\nSwimming is also a good form of exercise.", 
    "Another suggestion [and question] - will you be getting her food bowl/s?  If so, buy a slightly smaller one so she does not realise that she is getting a bit less food as it will look the same amount to her.\n\nI bought new small bowls for Tikva, who is a tiddler compared to my angel Pereg, and put the amount of food in according to the size of the bowl.  That way I did not have to worry about weighing it apart from initially weighing the meat for her second meal until I had gotten used to it by looks, and if the amount in the bowl looked like Pereg's did,  although of course much less, then that was the right amount for her. \n\nBut I still weigh certain things, although it was the smaller bowls that helped me to judge the amount of food she needs.  She also has a smaller bone meal for her breakfast, ie a chicken wing, or neck whereas Pereg would have half a chicken back or half a turkey neck.\n\nGood luck!", 
    "Hey guys, \n\nI'm going to need some help with my new puppy before he gets out of hand!\n\nI got a new puppy (Max, male), who is a rough collie. He's pretty much a dream, at 8 weeks old he has medium energy (like to sleep, or lay most of the day), and he is extremely easy to train also. On the first day I started to teach him Sit, come to me, and look at me. By the second day he was already responding only to my hand movements (commands) about 85-90% of the time. \n\nBut there is a MASSIVE problem that started to develop. My girlfriend has a teacup Pomeranian (Pusha), who is 3 years old and is just the SWEETEST thing in the world. We have a running joke saying that the only way she can hurt someone, is if she licks them to death. \n\nThe issue is that Max started to play with her, and he keeps biting her, and hurting her. She sequels, cries, and just after a few days she's very scared to be around the puppy. Now I know he's a puppy and he's just playing, but I feel like this is teaching him to become a bully, because he doesn't stop biting her even when she starts to squeal. Also, if this habit sticks with the new pup, than I don't know how we will be able to leave them both at home, without worrying that the puppy will seriously hurt the older dog (Pusha). \n\nAddition info: we invited a friend of ours, who brought her dog. Her dog is about the same size as Pusha, maybe a bit bigger and older. The puppy played with him but did not even try to bite. The pup only bites (play bites) my other dog. \n\nPLEASE advise on what to do, because if I can't solve this problem ASAP, than I'm afraid that Pusha will get injured. She's already starting to get really stressed out and I want for both of my dogs to feel happy and protected at home. \n\nAnd in-before anyone says that we should take him to puppy play dates, we can't. He doesn't have all of his shots yet, so it's going to be another 3-4 weeks before I can take him to socialize with other puppies. I already looked into all the puppy playtime a around my city, and all of them require your puppy to be fully vaccinated.", 
    "No, Stop, Heal and Sit commands.\nPast that a solid off command.\n\nUntil you have that down redirection and separation.\nDoubt it is aggression, more likely natural prey drive, or rough play because the other dog can not do a real correction to teach the pup.\n\nMy last mastiff DaVader had this issue at around 10 or 12 weeks because he just did know his size, with a dachshund, he loved the dog, but could not have 40+ pounds of puppy jumping on 12 pounds of small dog.", 
    "I would use a baby gate to keep them apart without either of them having to feel excluded. Until the puppy has learned how to respect the smaller dog, and play more gently, I would only allow them to be loose together while there was someone present to act as a referee.", 
    "Teach him the \"gentle\" command let him play and the moment he gets too rough, quietly and calmly intervene and separate him till he\u2019s calmed down. Then when he is more relaxed let them play again, firmly using gentle keep repeating until he associates the word with gentle play.\n\nI also use the word gentle when they start the mouthing stage.", 
    "Thank you for all your replies. \n\nI think it's better to be safe than sorry, we will keep them separated when they start to play. \n\nThe funny thing that some times, the Pom will actually start the play session (she started doing that yesterday and today), but it still turns into a problem pretty quickly because the puppy can't control himself.",

You would also be able to apply any other anti inflammatory meds directly onto the skin.

The symptoms include loss of pigment, redness, scaling or crusting of the nose with loss of the nose\u2019s normal \u2018cobblestone\u2019 appearance.

Her weaknesses are cold weather, separation anxiety, requiring a lot of time and exercise, growling/ raised fur at new people and animals, and expensive eating habits, sensitive skin and fur. The time, effort and money I have put into coping with these is nothing compared to the pay out of love and loyalty this dog has given to me. Zeppelin gets excited two streets before we pick my kids up from school, she knows where were going. She knows all her tricks in sign language. She is at my side at all times and is sad when im away, she's happy when im happy and cries when I cry. She remembers everyone she's ever met and when she hasn't seen a friend in a while she throws her self at their feet and cries in happiness begging for belly rubs. \nI think the time you could spend with your dog is perfect, the exercise, animal exposure, all of it! They are great working dogs and are so darn cute.", 
    "Hailey said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nA mal could be a really good choice for you from what you described, however you would need to be close enough to a town to be able to socialize the dog also. An unsocialized malinois is a bite case waiting to happen (well that's with most breeds but it's really bad with a mal)Click to expand...\n\n I agree with the socialization! I have been taking mine everywhere for a year and a half and she's still skittish with new people and animals",

Where do I start looking for a goid quality Malinois puppy? Any ideas ?", 
    "Hey!\n\nI've got a wonderful Malinois, he's great fun to be around and got all the traits a malinois is supposed to have. He's soon going to turn two years old (in may). However he's got some issues, to say the least, with other dogs we encounter on our walks.\nIm going to start off with telling you guys how a normal day in our lives look. This is to emphasize the fact that he is in no way understimulated - unless he's some sort of stimulation-craving doom-dog .\nSo, me and Rollo spend 24 hours of every day together. I work at a day-care for dogs and so we meet around 40-50 dogs every day, and has been doing so since Rollo was about three months old. After a long day of walks and missions in the woods with the other dogs - which Rollo helps me herd, making sure none of them strays too far from the pack - we spend about thirty minutes or so obedience training. In the weekend we often throw freesbees until we drop. I think it's safe to say that Rollo is a very active dog and he's got a great attention when we're obedience training.\nNow to the actual problem .\nPicture us walking, eye-contact almost unwavering (if I want it to be). Fifty yards ahead of us Fifi the bichon havanais, with her 60+ owner comes walking along towards us. Rollo has seen the other dog and his attention starts to split a little bit, but he's still focused enough on me. Fifi is getting closer and Rollos attention is still fine. When Fifi is just five small yards away, Rollos concentration suddenly breaks. He's become convinced that Fifi and her 60+ owner is going to murder us, and so he lunges towards them sounding like he wants to end both their lives and thus save the day. 2 or 3 out of 10 of these situations I manage to keep his attention and avoid a confrontation, but only if I brought something super-fun along, like a stick or a freesbee, although that trick doesn't always work. I'm not some meek guy with my feet pointing inwards, I walk with a straight back and Rollo knows in all other situations who's in charge, and yet he feels the need to protect me from dogs the size of his left hind-leg. To clarify, it's not just small fluffy dogs he hates. Basically he hates every other dog he sees initially. Even his friends from day-care seems to be a huge threat, until he actually meets them and realize he already knows them. If Rollo were to be off-leash in the Fifi-scenario he would run up to the other dog, looking very hostile indeed, head and ears reaching for the sky, tail pointing straight up and a nice long ridge of hair going from the neck all the way to the tail. By this time Fifis' owner is probably scared half to death. Then, when Rollo reaches the other dog, he just stops, assert his dominance and runs back to me. Needless to say the damage is already done, Fifi's owner is probably inches from a heart-attack by then. Rollo has never hurt another dog, he just speaks a language that is incredibly hostile.\nI want all of this to completely go away, he doesn't need to be playful or fool around with other dogs, I just want him to feel calm and pass other dogs like they are no more important than ants.\nI have no idea where this behavior comes from, I mean, he's been socialized since puppyhood for god's sake! When we work during the days I walk him with 4 other dogs without any problem at all! If Fifi were to start going to our daycare, he wouldn't bat an eye, he'd be super friendly.\nUsually Malinois are very sensitive and attentive (correct me if i'm wrong), but Rollo is a tough guy. He's not phased at all if I get mad at him for behaving like a jerk towards other dogs. In other situations, like that time he ate one of my pillows, he was soo ashamed, but when it comes to agression, it's a completely different matter. The strangest thing about his behavior is that it is non-existant when I'm working. It is as if other dogs are not the actual threat, the threat is the confrontation during our walks. Rollo's never been the playful guy with other dogs, he's more people-oriented, that's where the fun is at in his world.\nI've got some ideas on how to train this agression-issue, but I'd love to get some input from you, if you have read this far (sorry for the essay).\nOne of my plans is going into a densly dog-populated area and sit on a bench for hours with Rollo beside me, watching other dogs go by. When he manages to stay calm he'll get a treat, you get the idea. The goal is to de-sentisize, making Rollo blas\u00e9 of other dogs.\nThe other solution I've been thinking of is to neuter him. It may or may not work, but being a guy I somewhat dislike the idea and it feels like a shortcut, the easy and lame way out. Plus it may not work at all. However, one of his testicles is not where it should be and supposedly that may increase testosterone production because of the extra warmth from being somewhere up in his tummy. Anyway, that's what I've got to work with. I'd love to hear if you have similar stories to tell or if you have any ideas on how to counter Rollos behavior. I'm still holding on to the hope that it's just a youth-phase, but I suppose that might me wishful thinking .",

I haven't confirmed that the lump in fact is his testie but i'm pretty sure it is, so i'm going to follow the vets advice and not worry too much .\nHopefully we can get around his dog-agressiveness and turn it into something he associates with happiness instead. If that, or any of the other techniques, doesn't work I have to consider neutering, however if I know Swedish vets well enough, the fact that he's got an undecended testie is going to jack up the price tremendously.

    "I have noticed only a few pictures and posts from other websites mentioning a mixed breed such as one of my dogs. My female is a 3 year old Belgian Malinois Pitbull mix. It's a rare and very interesting breed to say the least. Anybody else have a similar breed.. I would like to compare personalities and traits! Layla is a very well rounded dog but does suffer from high amounts of energy, jealousy, and animal aggression. To put it in one word I would say she is very animalistic. Her breed should be used for military/police training in my opinion. You get the strength, agility, speed, and attention span from each breed. She is very eager to please and she seems as if she constantly watches and learns from her surroundings. Please feel free to comment or ask questions!\n\r\nShe is the one on the left.

    "I'm sorry to bump this topic when the last post was over a year ago, but after seeing the picture of your dog, I just had to post.\n\r\nI have a 1 & 1/2 year old female dog that appears to be the exact same mix as your dog. Infact, your dog is the closest match to her that I've seen in over a year of searching online.\n\r\nShe came in as a stray about a year ago and we've been trying to figure out what breed she was ever since.\r\nShe is extremely intelligent and clever, taking to tricks/commands in minutes rather than days. \r\nWhen she came in, she already had basic training and was already well-trained with basic commands. Whoever lost her/abandoned her had spent a lot of time training her, which is another thing that makes me thing that she couldn't have been just some random mutt.\n\n\r\nShe has most of the traits you described, except that she isn't as active as most Malinois are said to be. She gets uncontrollably hyper once she starts playing, but most of the day she just lays around. Once she gets going, she proves to be extremely athletic, jumping well over 5ft high. I know that Malinois are known for their jumping ability among other things, so this was one of the things that made me consider that she might have Malinois in her.\n\r\nShe also seems to have jealousy issues with other dogs. She seemingly gets mad if one of us gets anywhere near another dog.\n\r\nShe has yet to show any sign of aggression whatsoever and I hear that most pitbulls are like this, despite the reputation.\n\r\nHere is a somewhat straight-on picture:\n\n\n\r\nThe general head shape, coloration, eyes, and snout are all exact.\n\r\nShe has tufts of hair running down her neck, ending in little swirl-like patterns on the side of her neck. Your dog appears to have this same hair pattern, although it's a little hard to see from that angle.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nI'm pretty certain that she has some pitbull in her due to the shape of the head, but otherwise I really have no idea.\n\r\nHer coat is so perfect and symmetrical that I assume she must be a mix of two full-stock dogs. Every mixed+mixed breed I've ever encountered had at least one flaw in their coat, while hers is flawless.\n\r\nDoes Layla have any white patches or is the rest of her coat that same orangish/fawn color ?? Is her tail black like my girl's or the same color as the rest of the coat?", 
    "Shes gorgeous, looks very intelligent & alert. I dont think shes all that old? This would account for the boisterous play as a lot of the larger breeds take longer to mature\n\nShe has certainly got a lovely home now - well done for rescuing  & welcome to Dogsey",

    "Thanks for that Vee. I wonder how imports from the country of origin are dealt with?\n\nAlthough Chi's do have separate registers, breeders are able to register under the register that applies the individual puppy, ie. a longcoat from two smooths can be registered as that variety, and shown in longcoat classes. Last year, the Kennel Club briefly decided that the same rule could apply to the Dachs. varieties, but the opposition from the Dachshund Club was vehement, and the KC smartly recinded the decision.",

There was also a litter of Golden x Malinois that had brindles. It as unintentional, but with known parents. I'd say even with breed histories we can only go back so far, the origins of a breed might be known but how far back can the ancestors of those founders be traced? I'm not a Golden Retriever expert, but from what I understand they came from St John's Water dog (could carry brindle, what is their history?), Tweed Water Spaniel (liver color = chocolate could also carry for brindle history of this breed?). As well as other black and yellow (possible recessive red?) retriever types just as with the Labrador which also carries brindle and tan point. \n\nBesides the fact it is also proven with genetic testing and seen at times when a Golden or Lab is crossed to a non recessive red dog.  These are the genotypes for just a couple of the Goldens tested, of which the 100s tested in the database basically have the same / similar results. \nWithin the breed recessive red is set and found to be in 100%, 90% of Goldens tested has either an allele for black or allele for brindle (can be any combo), 100% have at least one allele for tan point (over 60% homozygous, while 37% carry recessive black).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabs which are related have similar genetics, however only around 77% tested for recessive yellow, as we know and can clearly see there are black / chocolate Labs. 99% likely having at least one allele for dominant black but possibly carrying brindle, 99% with at least one allele for tan point, 25% of those having recessive black, with less than 2% of the vast number of dogs tested having an allele for dominant red/yellow and most all being dominant black it's no wonder tan point / brindle is rarely seen.", 
    "Speaking on Flat Coats they are all visually black with most probably being homozygous for dominant black (not that its impossible a few could harbor brindle, just not something I've heard and think it's very unlikely. Unlike in the Golden or Lab, it either never existed or was lost), but like their relatives the Golden and Lab tan point is common with 100% having at least one allele for it and 63% having an allele for recessive black.", 
    "Ha Ha, I knew you would tie me up with genotypes.\nI think the St. John's Water Dog theory has been dropped, along with those mythical Russian circus dogs. You are quite right about the Tweed Water Spaniel though - which is a problem as they became extinct, and nobody now knows what they looked like. \n\nAccording to fairly recent detailed research carried out by Val Foss, et al., it seems that Lord Tweedmouth mated the original Yellow Flatcoat to a Tweed Water Spaniel, but then used an 'occasional' Irish Setter, a second Tweed Water Spaniel, and a Black Flatcoat to establish his own strain of Retrievers at Guisechan. He found that the line bred true to type, and the puppies were placed with friends and relatives, including Lord Ilchester, who also bred the dogs, and these became the foundation of the breed as we know it today. \n\nThe next time I see Val, I will ask her about her views on the likelihood of the breed throwing brindle. Thank you for taking the time to present all your evidence though - I will try to take it in, but to be honest, it makes my head spin, and at 75 there is not enough spare capacity  in my brain to internalise much more.", 
    "Lol sorry did not mean it to be confusing \n\nThe basic is that Goldens many times have black or brindle at the K Locus, but they are recessive red, so will always appear visually red. If a dog is homozygous for this trait then they can never have any black hair on their body what so ever. They can appear white like the Samoyed (who also carry black or brindle and tan point), cream, yellowish (mine is a very light yellow almost appearing white), various ranges of red from light to dark. \n\nThe wild Russian circus dog theory is out I know, but I thought it was possible St John Water Dog was used at some point, maybe not. I have seen founding pedigrees listing setter, yellow retriever, spaniel all of what you have mentioned. \n\nAlso Irish Setter is a rich red colored dog, caused by recessive red and is common to carry black or brindle and tan point so that could be the answer right there of where the Golden Retriever gets their colors for visual red and those they hide (black/brindle, tan point), but are capable of producing.",

If it was his fur (I'm assuming by measurement it was) then.....Somatic mutations can occur, here is a photo, but with much more black (sorry its a low quality photo, but it is a Golden).\n\n\n\n\nAlso remember many Goldens are masking black (or brindle) due to being recessive red which this gene causes a defect inhibiting skin cells from producing black pigment- this is why even though a Golden might be dominant black or brindle they will appear red. So anything \"going wrong\" in fetal development might make it possible for this black to show through and of course there are several unknown causes (and theories) of these somatic mutations.\nIn Ball Pythons we have what's called Paradox, it is somatic and non hereditary, same principle as recessive red dogs with black coat pigment (or any other out of place non genetic coat color).\n\n\n\n\nAlbino paradox - ALBINO like in most species is recessive in the ball python and the snake should be 100% albino but this one has splotches of normal pigment (genetically impossible - but happens with somatic mutation). This is pretty much the same as a Golden showing the black coat.\n\n\n\t\t\n With this paradox not even sure what went on lol they said the parents were Pinstripe and Mojave (names of genes which cause specific patterns)\n\nTo give you or anyone else not familiar, the ball pythons in this photo are Mojave and Pinstripe on top L to R... when paired together they would normally produce more Mojaves, more Pinstripes, Normals -bottom left and Jigsaws (combination of both Mojave and Pinstripe genes) shown bottom right. The above shows some normal and maybe Mojave pattern with washed out and broken splotches and yellow rings and splotches.\n\n\n\nI find that you get higher chances of these types of things in snakes (and unfortunately possible deformities) probably due to the incubation process.\n\nThough by going wrong (in dogs/Goldens) I don't mean anything is wrong in general with the dog, or parents or poor breeding, it is merely a matter of any little cell development interruption. Due to the complex development of mammals it is amazing things of a serious nature don't go wrong more often, let alone small harmless things.\n\nNo I don't have a Golden. Yes that's a lot of coat to prepare for show I imagine.",

    "Hello everyone! I am new to this forum, and I bring along my puppy Josephine, or Jo for short. She is a rescue dog so I am unsure of her exact pedigree but to me she looks and behaves just like a Belgian Malinois. Everything about her is Malinois, particularly in intelligence. We put her in training when she was three months old for a six-month course and she passed the entire course in less than a month! The only part of her that makes me think she is a mix is her size. She is nearly full grown (according to her vet) and she is barely 30 pounds. She is skinny, but her veterinarian attributes that to her puppy metabolism. She eats all the time! She has an incredibly sensitive digestive system too, so we only feed her grain free food which really seems to help. Anyway! I wanted some advice on how best to foster her incredibly high prey drive and protective nature. She is the sweetest dog in the world to those that she knows, but she is very hesitant around strangers. She doesn't bite or charge, but she does bark and her hair stands up on end. She is very protective of our home. I don't want these instincts to go away, but I would like her to be a little calmer around other dogs and humans. We take her with us everywhere we go (out in public) and have been doing so for about 6 months now. She does well, but is still skittish. How do I nurture her protective nature while making her more comfortable around strangers? Also, tell me if you think she is a Belgian from her picture! Maybe suggest another breed she could be? Thank you!",

Thank you for your ideas. I will have to ask my trainer about flirt poles. I really like the \"outdoor toy\" idea and the \"watch me\" command, too! \n\nIn regards to her training, the six month course we put her in was designed for puppies who are looking to go into professional service. Here in the States, Belgians in particular are used for the police force. Our trainer works with the puppies to get them used to order, command and excess stimuli like motion sickness from being in a car or bright lights and sounds. While Josephine is not going to be a police dog, we feel that due to her (at least partial breed) we are obligated to have her well trained. To be fair, the six week course was twelve hours in total, one hour every two weeks, with monitored practice by the trainer during the time in between classes. Josephine was lucky because I was able to devote more time to her practice outside of training sessions as I am a student and am home a lot. She learned and retained the commands taught to her very quickly in part due to the time I was able to devote to her but also because she is highly treat-motivated. Her trainer felt that it would be best to move her along as quickly as possible so that she would be able to build upon the commands she learned with as few gaps as possible. So instead of waiting the two weeks in between classes, she was taking new classes three-four times a week (and skipped the last class altogether). She knows all the basic commands (sit, stay, come, lay down etc) as well as how to listen to us when in a chaotic situation. She is also proficient in protection and therapy commands (ie; \"watch my back\" \"follow\" \"heel\" and a special one called \"patience\" which is used for therapy dogs to calm their owners down during a mental health crisis.) As a highly anxious pup though (she came from less than ideal circumstances) it is hard for her to focus in a new environment. She takes guarding our home very seriously and finds it difficult to discern between \"strangers\" and \"danger\". But as the other poster replied, it is best to keep socializing her as best we can until she grows out of her adolescence. \n\nThank you for all your input!",

We want Josephine to be comfortable wherever we go. She is a small dog so it is easy to take her to most places. If Josephine sees that we are okay with whomever she is barking at, most of the time she will stop and be friendly again. But in places like the lumber store or the farmers market, she regards everyone as a threat. The same with anyone who walks or jogs outside of our house. She also has a particularly hard time with bigger men. She cowers and runs away from them even if they have not approached her. I think she was abused as a tiny puppy, which is awful. I think all we can do is give her a safe space and set a good example for who is a stranger and who is \"danger,\" by socializing her and practicing her commands as much as possible. She is definitely improving, I just hate seeing her so anxious. Of course, I want her to be able to discern between a threat and what is safe. I understand that she doesn't need to like everyone ( I certainly don't  ) I would just like her to express her emotions in a way that is a little less jarring to innocent passerby. \n\nAgain, thank you for all your input.

The entire time she was in her training sessions, she was a happy little pup. You might have a misunderstanding of her type of training, as none of it was the same training that police or military dogs go through when they are older to prepare for confrontation or combat. It was training that service dogs go through when they are babies and adolescents, and was meant to socialize her, stimulate her mind, and make her easier to control, as she has a wild spirit (as most Shepherd-type dogs do which I am sure you know.) All dog owners have the responsibility to acknowledge that their dogs could be a liability one day, and so we have taken extra care to ensure that Josephine is happy, healthy and well adjusted. Her training was all positive reinforcement with pats, treats, toys and lots of fun games. She lives \"the life O'Reilly\" as the saying goes. She is incredibly spoiled by all those who know and love her. Without the training, she would be tearing up our front yard and be wildly disobedient.  As she is not a working dog, we want to make sure that her highly intelligent mind is stimulated and that she feels she has a \"job.\" As I am sure you are aware, a bored Malinois is a destructive Malinois.  Due to the circumstances I found her in when she came into my life, it is without a doubt that her anxiety has to do with the trauma she experienced when she was a tiny baby. She was abandoned on the side of the road to die on our border with Mexico at little more than three weeks old. She was not socialized with her litter and also lacked many of the necessary antibodies from her mothers milk to properly digest food when she was old enough. She was in the intensive care unit of our local vet for a month before I brought her home with me. I always knew she was going to be a challenge when I adopted her. I've worked very closely with her trainer, who as I previously mentioned, has been training GSDs' and Malinois' for many years and helped me to raise my baby Josephine. My pup is happy and healthy in all circumstances except in unfamiliar chaotic environments. It is also a new experience for her to have full run of our front yard as we recently had it fenced in to give her a wider area to run around and play. The joggers and passerby are a new stimuli to her so I would just like to know how to calm her down so that she knows that they are not a threat. \n\nIf you would like to learn more about Josephine, feel free to look her up or follow her on Instagram. Her daily adventures are posted under @joschmackos   \n\nThank you for all your help!", 
    "Hi!\nI'm new to the forum so firstly an introduction. I'm Tasmin, a dog trainer living in Essex (I train mostly aggression cases and general obedience) I'm extremely interested in learning how to train protection, detection and tracking/trailing but am failing in finding seminars or anything similar... any advice on that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have a GSD x Malinois named Rogue who is the best dog in the world. But I'm looking to bring home a new puppy (a Malinois) in order to work as mentioned.\n\nCurrently I appear to have two options, the first is a litter of puppies who are six weeks old, there's only one for me to choose but they are from working lines and IPO champions, both parents were imported from holland (van Joefarm lines) and the sire is working protecting celebrities in Ireland. Grandparents and aunts and uncles as well as previous litters have been shown to me in videos of the working and thladies it drive is incredible. This is the pup in the first pictures. The only thing is that obviously I don't get to choose my puppy.\n\nThe second option I have is a litter of puppies who are a week old currently and I'm the first to enquire so would get first pick of the litter, they are KC registered and five generation pedigree and both parents work for a security firm, although I can actually meet both of the parents there are no videos demonstrating their working lines or drive... but the breeder has said that I can perform any tests I like on the puppies and the parents and would be able to visit the puppies once per week to do anything I like in regards to spending time with them and developing drive. These are the ones in the last pictures. I've included pictures of both sets of parents too.\n\nThe last picture is of my boy Rogue as I've noticed with Malinois puppies it's hard to tell what their colouration will be like and although I'm not that concerned it would just be nice to have a different colouration. I love the Mals with a jet black mask and underside with the grayish light back but would also be happy with black mask and light fawn allover. Just looking for some advice.\n\nKind regards.",

    "Because a pup comes from working lines and IPO champions doesn\u2019t really guarantee it will excel in these sports, in a litter all the pups will not have the same qualities.\n\nAlso a lot depends on the trainers, good trainers can make stars from not the best dogs, and crap trainers can destroy the best dogs.\n\nA good breeder will know their puppies and point you in right direction of suitable ones.", 
    "Welcome to the forum Tasmin, and thank you for your photos. I wouldn't like to choose between the two litters, but I might want to take into account the parental health status, and check whether the parents might be too 'drivey', - though as a Malinois owner, you probably have done this already. \n\nHave you thought of joining a Working Trials Club? The stakes progress from Intro right through to PD, (manwork), and tracking is an essential in all stakes from UD upwards. The Benfleet, and Essex2000 clubs should be within your striking distance, and you will learn of their, and other, training days once you are in the loop. Google Working Trials Info for more details. I do find the site a little quirky to negotiate, and you will need to register, but it is free to view. \nDogs of all types and backgrounds - provided they have the right build to be able cope with trials jumps of course - should be able to progress through to a respectable level. A good trainer, someone you can turn to for advice, is essential for the basics, even though most of the work is done on your own. Though it is a great feeling to win a stake, in trials you compete to accumulate points which will allow you to add those precious qualifications after your dog's name, and that depends on your partnership - not who else was in your class on the day.\nGood luck with your decision - keep us posted.",

    "Hi, update. Of course, I realised that I wouldn't be able to choose for definite at that age (and we spoke to the breeder and asked if we could switch to available puppies as they got older as that was the only way around it) the puppies are now 7 weeks old and we fell in love with a pretty little girl. She's the lightest of the litter (I was looking for a dark sable) and obviously a female (I originally wanted a male) but she continued to impress us every time that we visited. Always curious and inquisitive and investigating loud noises but also extremely affectionate and loved attention. She's definitely the most confident of the litter.

Grandparents and aunts and uncles as well as previous litters have been shown to me in videos of the working and thladies it drive is incredible. This is the pup in the first pictures. The only thing is that obviously I don't get to choose my puppy.\n\nThe second option I have is a litter of puppies who are a week old currently and I'm the first to enquire so would get first pick of the litter, they are KC registered and five generation pedigree and both parents work for a security firm, although I can actually meet both of the parents there are no videos demonstrating their working lines or drive... but the breeder has said that I can perform any tests I like on the puppies and the parents and would be able to visit the puppies once per week to do anything I like in regards to spending time with them and developing drive. These are the ones in the last pictures. I've included pictures of both sets of parents too.\n\nThe last picture is of my boy Rogue as I've noticed with Malinois puppies it's hard to tell what their colouration will be like and although I'm not that concerned it would just be nice to have a different colouration. I love the Mals with a jet black mask and underside with the grayish light back but would also be happy with black mask and light fawn allover. Just looking for some advice.\n\nKind regards.Click to expand...\n\n\nDear All,\n\nI am based in Delhi, India. If you are looking for buying a Puppy, please consult a veterinary doctor before taking and decision.\n\nThanks,\nPurdian",

    "What a lovely dog you have Cameron. It I quite possible that there is a Malinois parent, but I think I see something else there too - something with a softer expression, possibly a Labrador. If so, this could be a good cross. Some Malinois are very high drive, and a little gundog breeding should make them a lot more relaxed to live with.\nThis is my best guess, but I will be interested to see what other Breedia members think.",

    "I wouldn't pick at 2 weeks. The breeder is the one in control of that situation. They should have made it clear that the pups will be chosen later, rather than let people pressure them. It looks like the pups will be fawn or black.",

Some stay fairly dark, though the fawn hairs will be more apparent. Typically they get lighter with age, but the black mask stays though how deep it is could lessen. Just the same the black on dogs ears and tails will reduce with age, but will retain some and be darker than the rest of the body. \n\nI find the loss of black true in breeds/dogs with different genes from one another. In Pit Bulls at times there is incomplete dominant between fawn and tan point gene so you get a dark over lay of black hairs, but a puppy who had a lot will be reduced as they age and could look surprisely different. Some keep a lot of it though. Sorry to ramble, I find the different coat color and genetics interesting.",

They are a strong-willed breed and rough play is all fun to them.\n\nTry ignoring - no eye contact, no sound, as little movement as possible - when he goes to mouth you. If he is very persistent even when he's getting no response, walk out the room for 15-30 seconds. At first, you walk out one heck of a lot, but when the light bulb moment happens, the mouthing stops as it's not gaining him any reward.\n\nGood luck x",

And my dogs have to know the basic commands by the time there 11 weeks old. And so far all of them have. \n\nThe basic commands I teach are =\nSit\nDown\nStay \nCome\nHeel (takes a little longer)\n\nSimple fun ones =\nSit on weird wobbly stuff\nRollover\nPaw/Shake\nTwirl/Spin\nFetch \n\nAdvanced Obedience/Fun Tricks =\nDown Stay \nJump of stuff to catch a Frisbee (my back ect)\nSit Pretty\nSpiderman (walk on it forlegs only)\nJumping through stuff (my arms, a hula hoop, ect)\nStand from a down or sit\nSit from a down\nHeel without a leash\nFetch different objects (a tissue, a pair of keys, toy ect)\nLook to the right/left\n\nAnd tons more! My Great Dane has conquered most of these. Please tell me below if you think I could make it with a Mal. Oh I forgot one thing, I don't know how to say this. I'm fairly stern/overpowering. What i mean is that I think I can keep him under control and I have worked with horses since is was 7 and am fairly strong if I needed to use it.

    "Almost nothing is known for sure about the history of the Chodsky pes because the breed was developed many centuries prior to the keeping of written records of dog breeding and in any case was primarily kept by illiterate farmers. What is known for sure is that the breed developed in the heavily forested southwestern portion of the Kingdom of Bohemia (now part of Czech) and that it appeared no later than the 1300\u2019s. Although it is unclear if they developed the breed themselves or acquired it from others, the breed first enters the written record as the companions of the Chodove, a unique subset of the Czech people who have lived in the region since the 14th Century. The Chodsky pes is very similar in appearance to a number of other Continental sheep herding breeds, especially the German Shepherd, Belgian Sheepdog, and Dutch Shepherd. Although these breeds are much better known around the world, all are significantly younger than the Chodsky pes and may be descended from it. (We know that it was used to develop the Czech bloodlines)\nThe homeland of the Chodsky pes has had one of the most turbulent histories of anywhere in Europe. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, the region known as Bohemia has seen countless battles, invasions, and waves of immigration. Located in almost the dead center of Europe, Bohemia sits right between a number of different cultures, languages, religions, and nations most of which have involved themselves in the region. The region\u2019s longest standing and most intense struggles have been between the Germanic and Slavic peoples, both of which have inhabited and attempted to dominate Bohemia since at least the 1st Century A.D. Eventually, most of Bohemia (and the neighboring region of Moravia) came to be inhabited and controlled by Czech speakers, although German-speakers remained dominant in certain areas such as the Sudetenland and all of Bohemia was a member state of the German-dominated Holy Roman Empire.\nThe Kings of Bohemia constantly needed to protect their lands, especially the border regions. In order to do so, they recruited the Chodove, which translates in English to, \u201cRangers,\u201d \u201cPatrollers,\u201d or \u201cWalkers.\u201d The exact origin of the Chodove is disputed, with different experts claiming that they were originally Silesians, Poles, or Czechs and that they were either driven from or voluntarily left their homes in either Silesia or Poland. The Chodove were invited to settle the Bohemian Forest, provided that they swore loyalty to the King of Bohemia and defending the territory from rival Germanic powers. One of the major factors in the success of the Chodove was their dogs, which proved to be of great assistance to them in their national defense efforts. Their dogs became known in Czech as the Chodsky Pes and in German as the Chodenhund, both meaning \u201cChodove Dog.\u201d The relationship between the Chodove and the Bohemian nobility was formally codified in 1325, when the Bohemian King John of Luxembourg granted significant unique rights and freedoms to the Chodove in exchange for their continuing service. Included in these unique rights was special permission to keep large guard dogs, which were otherwise illegal for commoners to own. These special ownership rights were one of the first formal historical mentions of the Chodsky pes.\nIt is unclear where the Chodove first acquired their dogs. Some have suggested that they brought them with them from Silesia or Poland (In Poland although not recognized by the FCI there is a similiar strike/race/breed), others that they were native to the Bohemian Forest, and still others that the Chodove acquired them after they arrived in the area.\nThe Chodove served as border guardians for almost 400 years, continuing to serve even after the Bohemia fell under the rule of Germanic Austria. Some evidence suggests that the Chodsky pes was being professionally bred and trained by the Chodove as early as the 1400\u2019s. If so, this would be one of the earliest records of such practices and also of a pure bred dog in the modern sense. Over the centuries the Chodove began to use the Chodsky pes for other purposes besides border patrol and war. Because the breed proved equally effective in guarding against wolves as it did against people, it began to protect and herd the sheep kept by the Chodove and neighboring peoples, becoming a very highly regarded sheepdog in the process. After a day working along the border or in the fields, the Chodsky pes guarded its family\u2019s home at night. Because the breed was in close contact with its family, only those dogs that were most trustworthy with children were allowed to breed, and the Chodsky pes transformed into a beloved family companion as well as a feared guard dog and respected herdsman.\nBecause of their long history of border defense and royal service, the Chodove were one of the most nationalist segments of the Czech population and played a significant role in almost every major Czech uprising and revolt until the 20th Century. Partially as a result, the last of their special privileges and rights were stripped away in the late 1600\u2019s by the local German aristocracy. Despite the loss of their special status, the Chodove remained in the area and kept their identity as a unique group. They also continued to keep their beloved Chodsky pes, although they were now primarily used as herding dogs and farm guard dogs rather than for military patrol. The Chodsky pes served as the region\u2019s primary working dog until the early 20th Century. During the final years of the 19th Century, German breeders developed the standardized German Shepherd from the Old German Shepherd Dog. This breed proved to be immensely successful as a police, military, and farm working dog and quickly spread to the Czech lands, which were at that time a part of the German-controlled Austro-Hungarian Empire. The German Shepherd became the primary working dog across most of Bohemia, but was never able to completely oust the Chodsky pes in its native land. A significant number of southwestern Bohemians continued to keep their native breed, especially those in the vicinity of the cities of Domazlice, Tachov, and Primda. In the aftermath of World War I, the Czechs of Bohemia and Moravia were granted their independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, forming the new nation of Czechoslovakia in union with the closely related Slovak peoples.\nIn 1982, Mr. Vilem Kurz sent several photographs of rare dog breeds that he thought were capable of being revived to Mr. Jan Findejs. Mr. Findejs was especially interested in those which depicted the Chodsky pes. In 1982, he wrote an article in a major canine journal about the breed, and what he thought its ideal standard should be. Mr. Findejs quickly found Chodsky pes owners very interested in reviving the breed which their ancestors had cherished for at least six and a half centuries. These original owners were all very insistent and aware that they possessed Chodsky pes and not German Shepherd mixes. 3 individual dogs of unknown parentage that Findejs considered to be the best examples were initially chosen to revive the breed, and the first Chodsky pes registry was founded. In 1985, the first every registered litter of Chodsky pes puppies was whelped, followed by a second the following year. The goals of Mr. Findejs and the other early breeders was always the same, to maintain the health, working ability, excellent appearance conformation, and family companion nature of the Chodsky pes. Realizing that three individual dogs was not nearly enough to revive a health breed, other surviving examples of Chodsky pes were sought out and added to the gene pool, although each new dog was carefully examined to ensure that it was an ideal and pure specimen. Throughout the revival of the Chodsky pes, the litters produced even by dogs of unknown ancestry have bred true to standards without exhibiting characteristics of other breeds such as the German Shepherd. This has seemingly confirmed the belief that the pure Chodsky pes had survived, and that it is not actually a recreation of an older type by use of mixes.\nIn November 1991, the Klub Pratel Chodkeho Psa http://www.kpchp.org/ \nwas founded to promote and protect the breed. Five years later, the last Chodsky pes of unknown parentage was entered into the breed\u2019s studbook. As time passed, more and more Czech citizens became interested in owning and reviving one of the country\u2019s oldest dogs. Although initially slow, recovery efforts have significantly picked up. From 1982 to 2005, more than 2100 breed members were registered by more than 100 individual breeders. An additional 1400 were registered between 2005 and 2009. The breed has quickly earned a reputation across the Czech Republic for being both an excellent family dog and a highly driven and capable worker. The Chodsky pes has especially made an impression in the Schutzhund and general protection dog community. The breed\u2019s medium size and attractive appearance are greatly increasing its popularity as well. Although the breed still has a relatively small population, it is now well-established in its native country and it is generally agreed that it will continue to substantially increase in popularity there. The health of the breed has continued to remain a very important consideration among breeders and mandatory screenings of parents (and acceptable scores on these tests) for several health conditions have been a condition of registration.\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/kalistadahlst...sky-pes-english\na friends site with some information in English",

I have a cwd/inuit or british inuit as they are sometimes known, she's called Neuri she is 9 months old and very steady,stable and pretty much bomb proof and I worked very hard to get her that way, I met both her parents and researched the dogs for many years,I've also worked with dogs and big breeds all my life so was well prepared, she is good on and off the lead, her recall is fantastic, she is loyal, loving, playful and protective of our family, she can be aloof if she doesn't care for someone but never shy, shyness in a cwd is a fault,its a sarloos trait not desired in the cwd.\n\r\nAlthough she's a cross theres alot of cwd present in her personality,she's not as hyper or neurotic as most inuits I've met, she gets excited for a bit but then sits and goes with the flow, we sit and have coffee in the park or a pint at the pub and she just settles down, she thinks alot and puzzles things out very quickly, she can be very sensitive so no shouting or harsh words but gentle solid leadership with lots of praise and treats gets these guys motivated and happy to learn, if they're not happy you will know \r\nsorry if I've rambled but I think these dogs are amazing and I am looking to get another* hopefuly 100% cwd if I can find one* within the next year or so.\n\r\nShe makes me laugh all the time, she has her flaws but so do all dogs, I truly believe if you raise these guys as part of a family, provide them with exercise and companionship, you'll get very few problems and I would certainly go for just one first,two pups will bond very strongly with each other first and you would have problems when they hit teenage delinquent stage and with a pup you can't oversocialise,take them everywhere possible! good luck donna.", 
    "Thanks bohochick,\nSounds just like the type of dog i'm after!\nAll dog owners are after that companionship and it seems due to the strong pack instinct in these dogs there can be a special bond between owner and dog that makes this breed that bit special", 
    "hi  \r\nto mention... i have a inuit in my pack as well as my csv and they are very,very different ....csv's have very strong 'character' and you should never be complacent about it.\r\nremember what they were bred for,with and why.;-) ;-)",

    "Hi Murph Neuri is friendly enough with others if we say its ok but if she doesn't like a person she will turn her back on them and ignore them totally but she has special greetings for who she considers our pack as my 14 year old says its like being mobbed by a furry Dino;-) (remember the flintstones) at times,the loyalty and pack bond is what first attracted me to them and they certainly are special in my book, now I can't imagine life without her! Donna.\n\r\nHi Tupac \r\nLucky you,I love both breeds,any chance you would list what you find different about the cwd and inuit because we keep trying to figure out what traits Neuri has inherited from both parents? Neuri certainly has a strong will and personality so I'm just curious as to what traits come from which breed thanks donna.",

    "Hi,\n\r\nI've just joined this site as I am seeking as much information as I can possibly get regarding the Czech Wolfdog.\n\r\nI would desparately love one and think it would be a perfect match with my and my families lifestyle.\n\r\nI've owned many breeds over the years from cross breeds to pedigrees, large and small. I've had some from pups and some I have rescued as they were aggressive and would have been put down if they went to a shelter\n\r\nMy doberman, Shadow (male) recently died and we all miss him terribly, including my Neapolitan x Presa - Axl (male). I can't remember a time I've only had one dog, I normally have 2 or 3 at a time (ages staggered). Normally 'dogs come to me' - i.e. someone needs a home for their dog, I've even 'found them' (a beautiful puppy Alsation we named Tara found her way to my doorstep and spent the night there before I finally opened the door and saw her the next morning - my neighbour saw her the night before but thought she was a fox) or someones had a litter of accidental puppies. However, no dogs have come my way and I thought I'd take the opportunity to 'choose' the new addition to my family and would really like a Czech Wolfdog.\n\r\nI dont want to go into this blindly and want to learn as much as possible before I seek out the best breeder.\n\r\nWhat confuses me is that I've read on some sites that they mix well with other dogs and on other sites it says they dont. First and foremost, I will not bring another dog into the home that wont get on with Axl (I have had dogs in the past who havent got on and I kept them separated and all was fine, but its not through choice that I would do that, only out of necessity).\n\r\nBecause I have a male I am looking to for a bitch (certainly not for breeding but being my first wolfdog I feel that a bitch would be easier to handle and I wont have to deal with the male to male dominance issue) - Can anyone with experience and knowledge advise me asto whether I can raise (from a pup) a wolfdog with my current boy (he is currently 11 months old and very socialised)???\r\nAnd how do they tend to get on with other dogs - my family have dogs whom we will see when I or they visit each other (we take ours dogs most places).\n\r\nI would also like to know what training techniques I could use as, from what I've read, they need more purpose to their training and arming myself with tips, tricks, techniques and methods will obviously help me greatly - I do not want to take it for granted that carrying my paper home from the shop and giving her paw will keep her satisfied.\n\r\nI'd appreciate as much info as poss - thanks.", 
    "Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs", 
    "Hello,\n\r\nI am from Germany (so please excuse my language mistakes), am a Veterinary surgeon and behaviourist and own 5 Czechoslowakian Wolfdogs (and know some hundred).\r\nCzechoslowakian Wolfdogs have been pure bred as a breed than over twenty years and undergone a extremly hard selection, especially for charakter, in the beginning being used as working dogs in the Czechoslowakian army. They are a registered FCI breed, registered in Group 1 the working dog class. There are dogs working as therapy dogs, rescue dogs, guardian dogs, companion dogs, sport dogs and and and.\r\nKnowing wolfes quite well and being stricly against hybrids I can tell you that Czechoslowakian (and Saarloos) Wolfdogs aren\u00b4t hybrids in the normal point of view. Nobody in the Wolfdog world understands the English point of view on them. They are about as difficult to handel as a Rottweiler.\r\nThe reason why they have kept the wolfish look was to avoid health problems, not to have tame house wolfs. As I wrote before they have been working dogs in the army.\r\nFor the wolf content of around 30%: We will never get a lower percentage as long as we keep them pure bred. It is a mathematical formula nothing else. If you cross two animals with a percentage of 30% you will get offspring with 30%, it says nothing about how high the wolfcontent actually is in the dog. With no new wolf crossed in since 22 years and a very hard selection for a non-wolf-charakter it doesn\u00b4t reflect reality.\n\n\r\nOn the other side, I am not sure if the ban in your country isn\u00b4t good for the breed. They have a big fascination for some people for the wrong reasons and being kept as show dogs or to impress the neighbours is something that hasn\u00b4t worked out well for any breed I know of. The chance for them to get into the wrong hands is quite high as soon as the new owner hasn\u00b4t got direkt informations or the possibility to visit breeders and owners and get himself an impression how the dogs really are. But for me it is really not understandable why I can\u00b4t visit your country with my quite well trained dogs or can\u00b4t show them at Crufts.\n\r\nIna", 
    "Hello everyone,\n\r\nI'm living in the Netherlands and have a Czechoslovakian Wolfdog too. My English isn't very good, but I will try to explain why the C. Wolfdog isn't a dangerous dog.\r\nWhy should a wolf be dangerous? He act just like other dogs. People makes dogs (animals) dangerous, with its own behaviour. I have a dog, which is very shy of people and wants only flee away from them. This type of behaviour is more a Saarloos Wolfdog one. They ran away for people and objects that makes them fearful. My dog has never been aggresive to people, because of his anxious behaviour.\r\nWhen it is safe (in his eyes), he behaves like a normal dog.\r\nOk, it's not a dog for a firstdogowner. But that's not because of his bite. \r\nThe wolf is a very shy animal in the wilderness and don't want to fight. Why should he? Injuries in the nature leads to the death.\n\r\nThe Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is a special dog, but NOT a dangerous one. Anyway, there are no dangerous dogs. Dangerous dogs are made by man.\n\r\nI gladly want to visit Great Britain and walk with my Czechoslovakian Wolfdog through the beautiful nature!\n\r\nGreetings, Jolanda", 
    "Welcome Igor,ina and nanoekie. \r\nYour dogs, I'm sure are wonderful creatures and are well looked after and well behaved, I have no doubt about that. \r\nI am still concerned that the last wolf used was used in breeding 22 years ago, my basic maths tells me that the wolf content could still be quite high. I'm afraid your posts have not allayed my fears about the breed being introduced here at all. My fears remain, in the wrong hands, as with any dog, they could have problems. They will appeal to 'the wrong hands' for sure. I don't think it's fair on the dog. I also still would want to know the EXACT wolf content in the breed.Dogs have been domesticated over 100's of years and we are talking about a cross with a wild animal 22 years ago. \r\nI am also a little surprised at just how quickly news of this thread has spread, 3 new members posting for the first time seems quite a high number to me. Sorry.\r\nDon't want to offend anyone at all, just expressing my opinions.

And another one to defend out wonderfull breed. My name is Mirka and I am from Czech Republic, country of origin of the breed Czechoslovakian wolfdog. And a proud owner of two wonderfull Czechoslovakian wolfdog females.\n\r\nI absolutelly agree with all that Ina said. To add anything to that, I\u00b4d only repeat what was said. \n\r\nThe breed was officially recognised by FCI in 1981, but years before the crossings were made. In fact, the breed exists for more than 45 years. The wolf-blood content is very hard to say, because no wolf was added to the breed for years. And frankly, I do not find it important at all. \n\r\nIt is not the wolf-blood content, that makes the character of the breed or of individual dog. It is only the breeder and the owner, who shape the character of the dog. It is the way they socialise the pups, train and educate the dogs. \n\r\nIn wrong hands, every dog goes wrong. To think, that in wrong hands, wolfdog goes worse, is silly. I would bet, that if the breed was called Czechoslovakian shepherd, this thread would not ever get so far. \n\r\nMy wolfdogs were attacked by these breeds: Golden Retriever, Siberian Husky, Malinois, Bichon and Staffordshire Terrier. Should I cry that these breeds are dangerous?\n\r\nWolf is beautiful creature, social, playfull, fair and wild. Wolf is not aggressive and dangerous beast, only silly people think so. Reading something else than Little Red Ridding Hood would help greatly. \n\r\nWe offer to anyone to come and visit us anytime and see for themselves, what kind of dog is CSW. \n\r\nOn the photo are our and friends very dangerous wolfdogs on a visit of a ZOO.;-)", 
    "I don't think there is a conspiracy Alisha   - we prob just got mentioned on one of their forums... thats what normally happens when you get new members go straight to one thread \n\r\nRegarding these dogs, I think many people are concerned because they feel they may be more dangerous than normal dogs, purely because they have 'wild' blood in them.  And they feel that once that get's 'out' they may end up in the wrong hands (as what happens to many other breeds).\n\r\nFrom a legal standpoint, as far as I know in the UK, a wild animals licence would be needed for any animal with more than 5% wild blood - but I'm not entirely sure on that figure so you'd need to look it up.\n\r\nThe reason I know this because I own a Bengal cat which also was created using wild blood (of the Asian Leopard Cat).  Although there is a massive difference in size, similar principles apply with regards to the law.  With Bengal cats it's not until at least 4 generations away from any wild blood that they are considered a Bengal.  All others are known as foundation stock.\n\r\nI can't remember the specifics now as it's been so long but I think the first foundation mating is a ALC X a domestic cat\r\nf2 is then the offspring of that x a domestic cat, f3 is then the offspring of an f2 breeding x a domestic cat and f4 is the offspring of the f3 mating x a domestic cat.  This goes on and most Bengals today are at least f10 or further, and I think their wild blood is less than 0.02%.  My figures might be completely wrong here mind so its worth researching it if it interests you.  What this shows is that the resulting wild blood in the 'Pet' Bengals is actually very very small (and so does not require a Wild Animals Licence).\n\r\nI guess people would be interested in how this differs to your own Breed? They are certainly beautiful animals (especially those two on the right in the pic above :smt049 ) but people will naturally be apprehensive about wild blood content in any pet, purely from the safety aspect.\n\r\nRemember, as ambassadors of your breed, it is your responsibility to do what you can to allay peoples fears - don't take them as insults, but just for what they are, genuine concern.",

I'm perhaps being a little naive, but surely good breeding records are vital in a situation like this?\n\r\nMy concern is for the welfare of the animals totally. I have to say, in all honesty, I am uncomfortable with the idea of x breeding wolves to make a family pet...we've done that already and got...well, dogs.... I still feel, very strongly, that the wrong sort of people will be attracted to this breed and the breeding will become a problem. This will happen if they are introduced here.  \n\r\nI haven't suggested for a moment that a wolfdog will become worse than another breed if it is poorly handled or trained, I don't know. I don't know if it is or more or less likely than other breeds to show aggression if cornered and it cannot flee. I don't know. As I say, my concern, the concern I have expressed, is for the welfare of the dogs AND I also (and am being totally honest and upfront) have issues about the ethics of x breeding from a wild animal.\n\r\nI'm sure the dogs are lovely and have commented on their beauty. My overriding concern is for their welfare. I have seen how many dogs, of certain breeds are treated, I have seen how they turn out. I would not wish that on these dogs.",

    "I'm inclined to agree with Ailsa on this one.  The domestic dog has evolved from the wolf over many thousands of years and latest research on this indicates that the first stage of domestication was a very slow process and initiated by the wolf rather than man.  The wolves most suited to tolerating the presence of humans would have been the ones to first take advantage of the easy pickings round the villages and these would have been the first ancestors of the domestic dog.\n\r\nThousands of years later the temperament of these would have changed enough to allow the wolf true domestication with the intervening selectional criteria being almost solely based on temperament.  This is confirmed in the latest DNA research where the biggest genetical difference between dog and wolf is said to be in behavioural traits.\n\r\nI too think these dogs are wonderful looking animals and agree that the natural phenotype of a wild animal is a very good starting point as far as health is concerned.  Also it's commendable that some are doing well in training and other disciplines.  I have not had the pleasure of meeting one but from what I have heard, the temperament is inclined to be nervous in some.  I know this can occur in any breed and I\u2019d like to hear from those of you who have experience, how they compare to other breeds in this respect.\n\r\nObviously there is going to be a wide range in temperament, as there is in all breeds but my concerns too, are that with so few generations in domestication, and without the ruthless culling of natural selection, some of these dogs will just not be suited to modern day living in human society.\n\r\nSomeone has commented earlier that a dogs temperament is shaped only be the breeder and owner and not by the parentage.  If this were the case, then we would have no need of specific breeds for specialist disciplines.  We could train our Siberian Huskies to herd sheep, our Basset Hounds to retrieve for the gun and out Labradors to do manwork.  All dogs are different genetically and it has taken countless generations to breed these traits in.",

However, people today are especially quick to point the finger at any dog that is different from the norm and Czech wolfdogs are different!!! You probably won't ever have seen the storm that certain tabloids kicked up in the early 90's with Killer Wolfdogs as their headlines, and all sorts of lurid (and totally innaccurate) information. In fact I was only saying to a friend the other day that the pit bull headlines by these tabloids were virtually identical to those of the furore they created over wolfdogs in the 90's, with just the breed name changed. Totally inoffensive dogs were confiscated from their owners never to be seen again. During the court hearings it was said that as far as the law was concerned any dog which had even 1% wolf in it would be governed by the DWA. It is all well and good to say you have the right facilities, fine, but not everyone who buys one off you will have these facilities, and people being what they are, sooner or later the brown stuff will hit the fan, and those puppies that you have bred and loved could well be the victims.",

Lets put down the horrible people that ruin dogs not the dogs and have a free country because not being legaly able to buy any breed is not Free.",

    "Hello everyone, thanks for taking the time to read my post. I have a 1.5 year old border collie/blue heeler/Australian Shepard mix (half Border Collie, quarter others). She is very social, I have her decently trained with basic commands and tricks. I am have big issues with her in introductions to new people. She seems very excited to meet them only to become aggressive, (or defensive..) when they start to pat or talk to her. I believe this may be a socialisation issue as I live in the country, and she doesn't get exposed to people on the daily. I have been trying to get her out as much as possible having positive encounters with people but she continues to freak out about 50% of the time at people, showing teeth and barking for no apparent reason. How do I get my dog to trust strangers and not freak out in situations like this. How do I install confidence in my dog to handle this situations. She only reacts this way to men which I dont understand. I am a man. Shes never been traumatised or beatin. My folks are starting to think we should get rid of her. Please help. Also my parents do have some sheep that I have had her around a few times for fun.", 
    "She doesn't need to be petted and fussed over by strangers, some dogs love the attention others don\u2019t. She may be more accepting as she gets older, but if all you get is her calmly ignoring people, that is good enough, patience and time.\nI wouldn\u2019t force her into a situation she\u2019s not happy with, find a quiet spot where you can just \"Sit\" and have her \"observe\" no need to interact\n Parks, outside supermarkets at a distance she is comfortable with are also good to expose them gently.\nMake walks enjoyable have her out experiencing sights, scents and sounds, take her places and have short training/play sessions and make it fun for her.",

    "My 16-year-old Border Collie, Arisha, experienced a seizure today. It was short, but it scared her badly. She saw her fall onto her side. It only lasted about 30-seconds. It happened right after she woke up. By the time I got her to the vet, she was fine. She has never had a seizure before. I know Border Collies are prone to epilepsy and the veterinarian said that at her age she will not likely respond to medication. She seemed really confused on our way to the vet. By the time we got there, she was fine. This is the one and only seizure she has ever had. I'm very scared that she might have another. The veterinarian said it is likely idiopathic epilepsy. Apparently it is common in several breeds. She explained to me that it is genetic and several genes must be switched on in order for a dog to have this condition (I may not be repeating this correctly). I was also told that it's recessive, which means both her parents had to carry the gene for it. It was a very long time go that we got her from a sheep farm and I don't remember her parents at all. The vet said this is the oldest she has ever seen epilepsy manifest. Before Arisha the oldest dog with epilepsy she saw was only 5. She has only had the one short seizure. She took blood to rule out hypoglycemia and it wasn't that. I was told that because of her age there may be some sort of metabolic or intracranial disease going on. She came home with me today, thankfully. I was told not to let her swim, which is hard because I have a pond on my property that most of my dogs love to swim in daily (I am planning on having it fenced off soon). The vet gave her an anti-epileptic prescription medicine. Unfortunately, it's going to make her fat so she advised me to cut back on her food before she starts to gain weight. She has an appointment in two weeks to have her blood chemistry done. The drug she is on is called phenobarbital. They want to make sure that the levels in her blood are stable or something. unfortunately, the blood test done today picked up a very slight decrease in kidney function, but the vet isn't worried about this, as it is normal for older dogs. I'm switching her diet to Blue Buffalo healthy weight formula and a prescription canned kidney food that I will be mixing together for her (to keep her lean and to help her kidneys). I know I can't control genetics, but I'm very upset that Arisha now has epilepsy. As long as the medication and food helps her, than I will be happy. The vet also gave me prescription treats for Arisha that are low sodium and she really loves them.\n\nI would love any advice/suggestions. Have you had a Border Collie with epilepsy? What worked and what didn't work?",

    "My beloved Pereg had idiopathic epilepsy, starting when she was 2 years and three months old.  Unfortunately hers was uncontrollable and I had to make the very hard decision to release her after four years.\n\n.  A 16 year old dog can not have idiopathic epilepsy but would have secondary epilepsy, usually caused by a trauma or brain tumour. Genetics have nothing to do with secondary epilepsy at that age, nor can Phenobarbital do much to help her.  And no vet should prescribe Phenobarbital after just one very minor seizure.\n\nIn addition, blood tests to rule out hypothyroidism, have to have a full panel done which has to be done by a specialist and usually takes about five days, not just a basic test done by a vet who, from the sound of it, does not know much about canine epilepsy.\n\nPerhaps you need to take your dog to a vet who actually does know about canine epilepsy.   Yes, certain breeds, Border Collies being one, who have a tendency to develop epilepsy, but there is no known gene which causes it.  It requires a trigger which has nothing to do with any known genetic fact.  And as I said, at that age it can not be idiopathic epilepsy but must be secondary epilepsy, caused by head trauma or a brain tumour.\n\nMy Pereg was a mutt of no known origin.  She has never had a head trauma or brain tumour.  She just had idiopathic epilepsy.  Epilepsy of no known origin.", 
    "Many years ago I had a Cavalier bitch which had a short seizure at the age of six. My vet at that time diagnosed epilepsy, but said that it was a late onset, and suggested that we waited to see if it happened again before giving her any medication. At that time a GSD friend was in contact with a well known geneticist, who also said that this was not likely to be the hereditary form of the disease, and that this attack would be secondary to some other cause. My girl lived to 14, which is a good age for a CKCS, and died of pneumonia due to Kennel cough. She never had a second fit, but did go on to develop a pancreatic enzyme deficiency.", 
    "An old article but it may be of some help (the author had a BC) http://www.dogsey.com/showthread.php?t=14937\n\nI agree that usually, epilepsy in later life may reflect an underlying condition (due to old age).\n\nPhenobarb is what my dog was on too, and he was fit-free for 6 years once we got the dosage right.\n\nGood luck and I hope you have many more years with your dog yet",

    "what happened during the 'seizure'? You say she fell onto her side, but did she stiffen or shake? Was she responsive to you during it?\n\nUsually a vet (or doctor for that matter) will wait to see if the dog (or person) goes on to have another seizure before looking at medicating because there are many things that can cause a seizure to happen - for example over-heating, over excitement etc.", 
    "Sorry it has taken me so long to respond. \n\nMy main veterinarian has diagnosed her with idiopathic epilepsy. She did not have any seizures after being put on this medication. I got a second opinion and the second veterinarian diagnosed her with Secondary Epilepsy, merely because of her age. Blood was run and known toxins were ruled out. This veterinarian told me to discontinue the medication. She had a distemper test run, just to be sure, but it was negative and she is up to date on all vaccinations. Her blood sugar levels were run again and were normal. However, certain types of epilepsy, such as Benign Familial Juvenile Epilepsy (as seen in the Lagotto Romangolo) have been discovered to be 100% genetic and DNA tests are even available for them. Even this second veterinarian told me that epilepsy is common in Border Collies and is genetic within the breed. Both veterinarians have told me this and I've read a lot about it online. I even had her thiamine levels run and it came back normal. The vet did a CT scan and found no signs of trauma. A tumor was also ruled out. We had her blood sugars run again to make sure they were staying within normal range and they never went too high or low. The vet went ahead and checked her thyroid levels, even though it is rare for thyroid problems to cause seizures, and there was no sign of thyroid disease.\n\nUnfortunately, after she was taken off the medication she had another seizure. I contacted both veterinarians and my main veterinarian told me that I should not have discontinued the medication and the secondary veterinarian told me to re-start the medication. The veterinarians are not in agreement if this is genetic or not, but both have told me that Border Collies and some other breeds are genetically prone to epilepsy. I've been told she is at the far end of the Border Collie lifespan, but she is doing very well for her age. She is now back on the phenobarbital and has not had another seizure. \n\nI appreciate the article, Azz. No underlying condition could be found even after a battery of tests. I plan on keeping her on the phenobarbital, as it is what has stopped the seizures. Thank you very much!\n\nI do absolutely everything I can for my dogs, money is no object, they are all very healthy and live to ripe old ages, so please don't get on me for what my veterinarian has said.\n\nThe seizure was right after she woke up, she started licking her lips, she tried to get up on her legs but was in a kneeling position, she then fell over shaking, the other dogs were sniffing her, I was freaked out but I just patted her back end and tried to calm her. The second seizure was much more severe; she tried to get up from her bed, she looked absolutely terrified, she was drooling like mad, she just kept looking around the room, she held one back leg up, tried to get up but started to shake, was stiff and in a half-sit half-laying position, slowly fell backward, eyes were very wide, shaking was not as bad as the first seizure, she raised a front paw, was looking like she was trying to get up but just kept rocking, her back leg came towards her front legs, tongue kept poking in and out, eventually rolled all the way onto her backside, kept her head and neck real stiff and tried to hold her head up, head kept going to the side, finally managed to right herself onto her bed, panted heavily, laid her head back down, then started wagging her tail, picked her head up and looked around the room, was able to get up, staggered over to me, sat down next to me, then got back up, I pet her to keep her calm, rubbed her shoulders, rubbed her neck, then she went over to see one of the other dogs, checked on another of her sisters, then another, went around to almost all the other dogs and checked on them. She was not responsive during either seizure. Both veterinarians are now agreeing to keep her on the phenobarbital and see if that stops them completely (second seizure happened less than 24 hours after stopping medication).",

    "Wanting a red and white border collie my wife, myself and my two children had booked a pup almost 12 months ago with <snip> in Dudley in the west midlands. My wife was constantly sending emails to the breeder. Eventually after waiting all this time she informed us puppies had arrived. We asked if we could visit in 3 or 4 weeks time and had a good 3 hour drive ftom East Yorks. We saw the pups, mam n dad and all of us especially the kids were excited.\nmy wife got an email off Jenny 19:30 on the 6th March. We arranged our work etc to go down and collect our Alice (pup).

My Mum's friend reckons it's because he was electrocuted by an electric fence when he was 1. He's very independent and i'm honoured if he looks at me when I call his name, nevermind get a fuss from him. He's brilliant in a training class environment but once he's on a walk he likes to do as he pleases. He's very laid back but can be a bit of a unpredictable character when the mood takes him.\n\nJessie is naturally very well behaved, very gentle, loyal and you could easily forget she's there. She seems to have a nack of just knowing how to behave, without me telling her and isnt interested in other people, other dogs, cats etc. She can be very timid but once her confidence is boosted she has lots of drive. She's obsessed with tennis balls and loves swimming.\n\nEdited to say my fave colours are a well marked tri red or blue merle or a striking black tri, all rough coated.",

    "Hi  \n\r\nI'm new here but hoping you can give some much needed advice please \n\r\nWe are seriously looking to get a dog sometime soon, we have 2 children age 14 and 5 and a large 4 bed house with a very good size garden so there is space to play fetch  . I'm not working so am at home all day and my hubby works shifts so is around a lot of the time.\n\r\nWe've never had a dog before as a family but hubby had a border collie as a child ... and he really wants another border collie this time - he loves their intelligence and would love taking it for long walks on his days off.\n\r\nI *think* we have got the time to devote to a border collie but I have a few concerns / niggles - hopefully some of you with more experience can help with these ?\n\r\n- grooming, honestly how much do border collies need / how often / how long does it take?\r\n- exercise, would a border collie be happy if we let it out in the garden morning and evening for a quick run around and toilet and a proper walk during the day (at least 30 mins)?\r\n- temprament, what are border collies like with children?\r\n- being left, generally at least one of us is at home all the time so the times the dog would be left would be really minimal, but approx how long can a border collie be left for (assuming it has had all usual exercises beforehand)?\r\n- activity, how much stimulation / mental challenges do they really need?\n\r\nWe would have time at weekends to go out for much longer walks, we aren't particularly sporty or active people but would always make sure the dog had what it needed.\n\r\nIs there a X Breed that would be better for us to consider that perhaps doesn't need as much exercise, but still has border collie characteristics that my hubby loves?\n\r\nAny thoughts of advice welcomes \n\r\nThank you\n\r\nx",

    "Welcome to Dogsey sorry never had a Border Collie but fair play to you for trying to gather as much info as you can before you decide Good luck", 
    "I can't imagine a border collie would be happy with 30 mins exercise a day. Even my Pugs would feel deprived with that tbh\nHave a look here\n\nhttp://www.breedia.com/dogs/border-collie", 
    "We have a collie cross retriever she would be fantastic with children and having retriever in her is steadier than a collie temperament wise. \n\nShe is happy now with 20-30 minutes a day walk BUT she is 12 years old and has dodgy hips when she was younger we needed to take her much further each day and not just once a day either a good hour morning and evening plus plenty of fetch games as well. \n\nShe has collie rounding up traits which if they were any more pronounced I would find annoying, being rounded up as you walk sounds funny but gets old very fast we found. Also she used to have a tendency to bring ducks to us when we walked near the river, rounding them up and driving them along the path - no idea what she thought we wanted them for", 
    "I don't think that amount of exercise would be suitable for a border collie at all. I've had a colliexshepherdxwhippet and he was very collie like with an insatiable appetite for exercise when he was younger. \n\nThe collie I walk at the moment has a half hour off lead walk int he morning and evening and I take her out for an hour at lunch time and she runs with my Bull Lurcher and staffie for the whole of the walk. She has company all day so gets a lot of attention and mental stimulation as well. The collie next door to me has a walk twice a week and somehow manages but I don't think it is a happy dog at all. It also has company all day but barks a lot and is shouted at a lot. Although I'm sure there are collies who live very happily with children it's not a breed I would choose to have with children. They can be very sound sensative and are fairly sensative anyway, highly intelligent and then of course you have the herding instinct. All completely workable with and they are amazing dogs, but I think you have to know what you're doing and be prepared for a high level of exercise, training and ways to keep those amazing minds entertained and happy.", 
    "I have a lurcher who is part border collie - he is only 6 months old at the mo, but I think he'd go mental with only half an hour walkies a day, even with playing in the garden!\nI can only imagine a full collie would be a whole lot worse lol\n\nCollies have different coat types - some long, some short. Obviously the longer ones need more attention towards grooming, but it depends on the dog/coat type \n\nHave you considered having a look a different rescues?\nThere are usually all kinds of dogs there and staff/volunteers can help match the perfect dog", 
    "A for the cross breed bit I think you'd have to go for an adult rescue to know the level of exercise they'd need. Many collie crosses still have a high level of energy but you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell that from getting a puppy.", 
    "Hi, I got a small BC from a rescue centre at 6 months and she was very neurotic at first and took a while to settle in with us .. don't know where she had been previously but was originally from working stock.\r\nIt's taken a while but now at 2 1/2 she is the sweetest dog and loves adults, children and especially teenagers.. anyone who will throw a ball or spend one to one time with her.\r\nShe loves interaction and to be set challenges.\r\nI work from home and she has adjusted well to this and to chilling in the evening.. \r\nAs a guide she walks (or more accurately runs) for 20 minutes first thing, 3/4 hour at 11.30 and again at 3.30, 20 minutes before dark then again before bed.  She settles well in between and will soon let me know if I over run with work!\r\nShe's a joy to have around and keeps me fit and healthy.", 
    "Whilst I dote on the BC, I would say that our last dog was a cross BC/ lab and was more obedient and eager to please than the Pure BC. Great combo!", 
    "Agreed that the 30 mins exercise you listed most likely won't be satisfactory. However, as for energy levels in general, if you're looking for a Collie with more of an \"off switch\" I'd go with the show line Border Collies and stay well away from working Collies! The show lines tend to have more coat but it's nothing excessive and I'd say a short 5/10 minutes groom a day or every other day would suffice. As with all dogs, temperament is dependent on the individual dog and it's upbringing and experiences. I have heard that some Border Collies can be a bit iffy with children, but this mostly comes down to lack of understanding on the owner's part and most of the behaviours that crop up tend to be related to herding. Again, something that would be more evident in working lines.\n\r\nI had a Lab x Collie when I was a teenager living at home and he was the best dog ever! Had less energy then a Collie but still had plenty of stamina and could walk for miles when needed. However he wouldn't be bouncing off the walls or too unhappy with two 30 min walks a day either. Was just a great all round dog.", 
    "Hi,\n\r\n it would be good to find your nearest Border Collie rescue, go meet a few and see the main reasons for re-homing. Good luck in your quest and let us know how you get on", 
    "I have had collies for many years and can't imagine having anything else now.\n\r\nHowever......it doesn't sound as though it would be a suitable breed for your circumstances.  Half an hour running about would not be enough physically and they also need a lot of mental stimulation.  My collies have half an hour first thing but then anything up to an hour/hour and a half when I get home from work.  Then they go agility training...........\n\r\nAs far as children are concerned, I have one who adores small children (because the breeder had one) and one that I wouldn't trust alone with a child (because he's not had much to do with them) but collies can be bouncy and herdy if not otherwise occupied and will pick on small children to round up if there is nothing else around.  Nipping is one of the ways collies encourage sheep to move, which is why it can happen to children.\n\r\nYou could be lucky and end up with a couch potato - such collies do occasionally exist - but I can think of much more suitable breeds.\n\r\nGood on you for doing some research - there are many many collies in rescue because people rush into buying a cute puppy!  Good luck.", 
    "One of my 3 dogs is a Collie. He's 8 years old.\r\nAs he gets older his demands for exercise have decreased to the point that now he needs 45 minutes early AM, 1 - 1.5 hours during the afternoon and 45 minutes in the evening (regardless of daylight or dark). \n\r\nNow, if this sounds like a lot please let me explain; we 'get away with so little' because he is one of three dogs (and my son also has two dogs that join us for the exercise periods!) so the dogs run each other (we don't do too much lead walking).\n\r\nWith kids - relies on how you bring them up; our 2 granddaughters know/love/respect the dogs because the kids were taught at an early age how to be with the dogs so i.e. not to pull fur, not to encourage licking (hate it!), not to shout and scream, how to pet/fuss/groom AND feed the dogs.\n\r\nThe dogs DO have a few hours a day when they are alone (but with each other) and this does not cause them any problems. Key feature is routine - they know when we will be back because it's always the same time!\n\r\nMost of our spare time is dog related - with 3 it has to be but this is the commitment that is needed and we wouldn't have it any other way. We even holiday in the UK so the dogs can always go with us.\n\r\nLook around and you'll see that many Collie owners have them in pairs - they do like each others company and they do play well together. If you are seriously thinking about one I'd suggest considering two (and the vet bills that double).\n\r\nGood luck and I hope my honest comments don't put you off.", 
    "Can you explain the characteristics your hubby admires in the BC, because the characteristics of the breed make them an unsuitable pet for the needs you have listed.\n\r\nThey are super active and intelligent dogs, they have minds that need to be worked, if not they will find ways to do it themselves, and as such many end up with undesirable traits.....car chasing, herding , nipping, all natural instincts for the breed, and if not exercised enough can become problems.\n\r\nTo be honest with the lifestyle you describe, I would recommend a less active breed, something like a cavalier King Charles, pugs, Boston terriers , or even some of the larger breeds that are less active, something that will take longer walks at the weekend, but will settle for a couple of half hour walks a day in the week.", 
    "Have to say even Betty and Chihuahua needs more than two half hour walks a day she becomes totally naughty and destructive with less exercise.", 
    "Maybe the OP would like to consider a Lurcher or Greyhound? My Lurcher boy is happy with as much or as little exercise as I can give him. For example, some days we will have longer walks then others. But he'd be completely happy with a 30 min run in the field and then come home and crash out for the rest of the day. He's laid back and just a very easy dog basically.\n\r\nWith Lurchers it depends on their overall mix as to how energetic they are. The Collie cross ones can be just as full on as the purebreds. But my boy is a Lab/Whippet/Saluki and he's as mellow as mellow comes.\n\r\nGreyhounds are known for being couch potatoes. As sprinters they are happy with a good run about before coming home to collapse ( usually on your sofa ) for the day. They can walk further if that's required, but they are not hikers. Generally very quiet, patient, affectionate and gentle. The ex racers I used to work with all used to be lead trained already and were ready made pets. Many went to family homes.", 
    "Interestingly enough I've had another inquiry from a collie owner. The dog is ten year old and the woman has recently returned to work. Previously it was getting a walk morning and evening and had company for the large majority of the day....it's still getting the walks but has entertained itself with learning to break out of the house...so they left it in the garden thinking it would be happier there....and it's started escaping from the garden. Ten years old and it ran with Remus for an hour with no trouble at all. I really hope they call me as Remus would love another friend to run with regularly! \n\nSeriously though...that's a good example of what they will turn their amazing brains to if left unguided, lacking in exercise and stimulation.", 
    "As one who has suffered for years from 2 collies that are from the Local Dogs Home, and are in totally the wrong homes, please listen to what people are telling you. If they aren't stretched and exercised enough, then they will turn their intellect to other stuff, like attacking my dogs instead in this case.  I am so anti-collie now I scare myself all because they are in completely the wrong homes with elderly people who walk with a stick and leave them to their own devices, they let them offlead and walk off, the dogs do what they want.....:-( One has recently passed away, and it sounds so awful, but I was glad, only surprised it never got run over years ago.", 
    "I have a 2 year old border collie x she's a short coat so moulting not a great issue she's good with children but has spent a lot of time around kids so knows how to behave and she is generally good with other dogs apart from border terriers who she seems to hate with a Passion but that's another story,  as for exercise she starts her day by dropping her saliva sodden bouncy ball directly onto my face normally around 5 - 530 am her 1st walk lasts about an hour on and off lead playing her idea of fetch etc, she will then spend the rest of the morning playing and tormenting our other dog boxer x pup 'Bruce' who despite having healthy energy levels himself spends a lot of his time fast asleep exhausted by 'Bons' constant badgering. The 2 of them get another walk and run around lunchtime for 30 - 45 minutes, bruce will flake out for an hour or so whilst bon is still ready for more and will maybe pop into the garden and run up and down garden with our neighbours labs,  ready for a sleep? Nope, at best if you ignore her long enough she might sleep her way with 1 eye open and 1 ear pricked just in case you are up to something, she will then play with bruce when he wakes up, play in the garden, do some training with my OH, then i get home from work and ill take her out for another 1 - 2 hours run and walk,  then eventually around 10pm she will get into bed and settle ( still with 1 ear pricked though ) and I don't hear from her till the early hours.  I should add she was unwanted pup from a working dogs litter due to her colourings which explains her endless energy plus she is the 1st dog I've owned for a long time and I made many mistakes in the early days the main one being unlike yourself not researching the breed and being better prepared for some of the challenges some pups can bring ( car,bike,jogger,other dogs herding, seperation anxiety, jeolousy etc, etc) On the plus side she is affectionate, happy, funny, obedient and loyal basically a great companion. If you go with a bc and get it right from day 1 it will be a great addition to your family whatever its energy levels and walking him or her 30 mins a day wont be enough for you let alone the dog.

    "Hi there, I'm hoping for some honest advice! Sorry this is long but there is a brief summary at the end...\n\r\nOk, so, we've just heard from our landlord that we can get a dog. I'm over the moon! Problem is, we can't decide on a breed. At the moment we're thinking we'd really like either a whippet or a border collie - and yes, I'm aware that's like choosing between two different lives...\n\r\nSo here's some background. Firstly, I work from home so the dog wouldn't be left alone for long periods. But secondly, we live in a second-floor flat in the city, with only a communal garden - though the flat does back onto a park which is always full of dogs, and we're also a short walk away from lots of other parks and a 20 minute drive from rolling countryside. \n\r\nI've kept a dog in a gardenless flat before - a black labrador back when I lived with my mum - so I'm experienced in the joys of house training with the added 'fun obstacle' of a few flights of stairs, and in the bedtime and breakfasttime bathroom break rituals that it requires. My lab got plenty of exercise and when we registered with a new vet she actually asked us if Jess was a working gundog, she was in such good condition. We're not getting a labrador this time because my partner isn't a huge fan of them, which is fair enough.\n\r\nMy partner has had springer spaniels before, so he knows about (and loves) high energy breeds, and we're both doing as much research as we can so we know what we're letting ourselves in for. \n\r\nMy question is: do you think we could give a good home to a border collie? I wouldn't be keen to do agility or flyball (I'm quite shy and just not that sort of person) but happy to go to obedience classes and do lots of training at home, and plenty of fetch with tennis balls and frisbees. I also love running, and would like to take my dog on long runs once it's old enough. I think BCs are just beautiful dogs and love that intelligent focused glint in their eye when you're teaching them something new.\n\r\nOn the other hand, whippets are beautiful, cuddly dogs, and I get the feeling they might be the more sensible option for our lifestyle - quiet and loving around the house, and not too demanding exercise-wise. I'm sure I could fall in love with a whippet pup. But I'm not sure a whippet would cope as well with coming on my long runs, and my partner and I have both always wanted a BC. What do you think? I've never owned either a whippet or a BC before, so it's all a bit new.\n\nTL;DR summary: we are active and keen people who love to run and play fetch, but live in a flat and wouldn't do agility or flyball. Could we make a BC happy? Or would a snuggly whippet be more up our street?\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help. I'm trying to learn as much as I can before we make a decision - I know how big a responsibility it is, so I'd like to have all the facts and advice from you all, especially if you have kept a BC or a whippet in a flat before!", 
    "how about a french bulldog !!!! such funny dogs", 
    "Hi toadvillage \n\r\nI am the owner of 3 whippets and if you choose carfully you may find that a whippet will make a perfect running partner. Tilly was bread to show and after half an hour out and about she needs to sleep for the rest of the day. then there is Tizzy the racer she could jog by your side for an hour or so. Or Flossy the working whippet. she is 10 years old and is like a work horse whe will keep on going for ever. A shorter legged more stocky whippet would make a perfect running partner and also the best snuggle monster in the world", 
    "Oh I'd have to say a whippet.  I love border collies for much the same reasons as you do but I just think a little whippet would suit your lifestyle so much better.  There's a little whippet a few doors away from me and he is sooo laid back at home and yet charges around for his ball when out and about, he's an adorable little chap.  Everybody in the neighbourhood loves him.  He doesn't appear to suffer an ounce of separation anxiety either.", 
    "Thanks for the replies so far! We've been talking about it more and despite the sensible whippet advice I have to admit we're leaning much more towards a BC. I've found a great breeder close by who will have some pups soon and have told her everything about our situation, and she is supportive and has offered to help out with making sure it's the right environment. Whippets are still in contention, but I'd love to hear some thoughts from BC owners, especially those who don't do agility but still find fun ways to amuse their BCs?", 
    "What is making you lean more towards the BC at this moment? Is it anything in particular or is it the sweet temptation of soon to be puppies nearby?  \r\nWhat you describe as the focused glint I call the demented gleam, Lol. My first dog was a BC we had great times together but I wouldn't pick one for myself now.\n\r\nThere are all sorts of things you could do with a BC, but if you would be doing it purely to amuse the dog rather than to amuse yourself would it start feeling like chore over time?\n\r\nBeing shy doesn't really matter for agility, you could join a club that does it on a fun level.\n\r\nPerhaps you could make a post listing the things that you like about the two breeds and also make a separate list of qualities/traits that you would find difficult, unpleasant or stressful. I'd also do a wish list of what your ideal dog would be like because you never know someone might be able suggest another breed that would interest you based on that.  \n\r\nI brought my last pup up in a house where the garden was across the road so the toilet training regime was essentially the same as for someone in a flat. I think if you are dedicated and know what to expect (which you do  ) then not having a garden of your own needn't be an obstacle to any breed.", 
    "With your life style, I would go for a Whippet. Once mature they will settle so you could get on with your work.\n\r\nMy Whippet was bred for showing but would be quite capable of jogging with me for an hr. ( thats if I was capable.)", 
    "Sorry, I have no experience in either breed, but want to wish you luck with whichever you end up with. I have just got a puppy, exciting times eh?", 
    "Tricky! Like you say, they are dogs geared for totally different lifestyles.\n\nI can only comment on the whippet aspect, as I have two. Here are my thoughts:\n\n1. A whippety would fit in brilliantly with you working from home. Once they've had a walk or run,  they are happy to just chill out and relax without demanding attention all the time. They are very chilled in the house (assuming they get enough exercise and stimulation); I'm not sure how a BC would fare in that respect.\n\n2. Whippets are an ideal breed to live in a flat. They are easily house trained and very clean. They don't attract mud, they dry quickly, they don't smell and grooming is very low maintenance. This would not be the case with a collie; I wonder if it might be more difficult getting them up to a flat after a muddy walk etc.\n\n3. Whippets can be great running partners.They have surprising stamina when trotting at human jog pace. One of mine in particular would happily jog with me for hours (if only I had the stamina!)\n\n4. If you want to train in obedience, whippets are not the easiest. My trainer is forever telling me I \"need a border collie\" if I want to get anywhere!\n\nHere's a suggestion...what about a whippet x collie lurcher? Best of both worlds!", 
    "Hi,\n\r\nI am a BC fan, although only had BC crosses. We currently have a springer spaniel/collie cross pup (13 weeks old) and our previous dog was a collie cross too. When we chose our pup we wanted one that had lots of energy for long walks and possibly to run with me too. Dougal is 13 weeks old now, since he has been going out on his walks, he is much calmer in the house \n\r\nI agree that whippets seem more suitable to living in a flat but if you are active outdoor people and can ensure they get plenty of outdoor exercise, I don't see a problem with either breed. ;-)", 
    "Thanks so much for all the help and good wishes.\n\r\nBones, I'd love a springer/collie cross. Having had springers and collies before, I think they're our ideal mix - but it's hard to find them! You don't exactly get springer x collie specialist breeders! I would ask around local rescue centres but so many have an automatic 'no garden, no dog' policy which is really frustrating, knowing that I've kept a very happy dog in a flat without a garden before with plenty of exercise and attention and no problems.\n\r\nOK, here are the things we want in a dog:\n\r\n1. Happy to go on long walks and runs (I've done 20-30 mile charity walks before and it'd be nice to take a dog along if it could handle it!)\n\r\n2. A good companion for someone who's at home all day. Fun-loving and tolerant of lots of games and play (my lab used to get bored of playing with me long before I got bored of her... which is possibly a bit pathetic of me! She used to look at me like I was crazy and then go and have a nap)\n\r\n3. Having grown up in the country, we both like rugged-looking, hairy, practical-looking dogs. I think this is what's putting us off a whippet the most. We like bouncy breeds with lots of endurance which could mean something like a BC, but also dogs who like a good cuddle, which I know a whippet could supply.\n\r\n4. We live near some nice dog-friendly beaches so it'd be fun to take a dog swimming there - so dogs that hate water might miss out on the fun.\n\r\n5. Not a barker - basically, we don't want lots of barking that would annoy neighbours. This is the downside of living in a flat. I'd be around a lot so hopefully able to stop barking before it got too bad, but I'd like to avoid an especially shouty pup!\n\r\n6. I have generalised anxiety disorder so basically I'd love a loyal friend who is always around for a game and a cuddle if things start to get a bit much. But then I  think that probably covers all dogs!\n\r\nI think it sounds like a crossbreed would be good for us, but it's so difficult to find one from an ethical source. I don't think most rescues would give us a second look because of the garden issue :-( but maybe it's worth asking?", 
    "What an exciting time for you both.  From what you say you sound like you'll be ideal responsible dog owners whatever breed you decide upon. \n\r\nI grew up with a colliex who was a fantastic dog and I've also got a friend with a whippet. Both lovely breeds.\n\r\nThere are so many border collies in rescue, could you consider taking a rescue on in stead?  \n\r\nGood luck and do let us know what you decide on.", 
    "Every rescue has their own criteria; many will consider cases on an individual basis, so they flat issue may not necessarily be a problem. That's certainly the case with the whippet and sighthound rescues I volunteer for", 
    "Well, I went to a rescue today and had a good chat with the staff, and... they said it sounds like I'd offer a great home! They were so lovely and helpful - thank you everyone for encouraging me to pursue it. It was a bit heartbreaking seeing all the dogs so obviously distressed at not getting enough exercise and play, though. I did just want to bring all of them home!\n\nGoing back tomorrow with my OH so they can make sure he's not a madman or anything but so far things are looking great... and there's a lovely bouncy collie boy who caught my eye today, and who they said would be a good match for us, so fingers crossed. I'm really excited.",

    "They do have lots of breeders of springer x collies they are a new designer breed called sprollies, the dog in rescue sounds great, exciting times ahead", 
    "Hi,\n\r\nYes, I must admit the spaniel/collie mix is our perfect dog.  Before we got Dougal we were looking at a rescue preferably of collie mix but we saw the advert for \"sprollies\" and they matched what we were looking for. The litter was not bred as a designer mix either, just an accidental litter  \n\r\nFingers crossed for the rescue collie, I'm sure you can give him a good home.

Her little information sheet just said 'Unwanted'.  :-( I don't know how anyone could not want her, because she's very bouncy and friendly and polite and just about perfect...\n\r\n...so, long story short, we're bringing her home tomorrow! Thank you so much for all of your advice, everyone. I think she may actually have a little bit of whippet in there somewhere - she's got an unusually delicate little face for a collie, and she's super super cuddly. I'm so glad I checked out the rescue centre, and that's all thanks to this thread. I didn't think they'd consider us but they were great about finding a dog that would be a good match. And it's all happened so quickly! I need to buy a dog bed now!",

    "Okay, so I'm not quite sure of my dog's breed. The papers from the Humane Society that I got her from said that she is a border collie/lab mix but the papers from the shelter that she was originally at says that she's a border collie/shepherd mix.\n\nI do see a lot of similarities between her and other border collie/labs except that she has pointed ears rather than floppy. I noticed in some pictures that I've found that border collie/shepherd mixes have pointed ears. Most of them I see don't look much like her at all but I did find some pictures on Google that look just like her and they were labelled as border collie/shepherds.\n\nThese two look just like her:\n\n\n\nI feel like she'll possibly look like either of these when she's older?:\n\n\n\n\nSo, I'd like to get some second opinions.\n\nBorder collie and lab or border collie and shepherd (although not sure as to what kind of shepherd)?\n\nShe is roughly 5 months old. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne tip of her ears is slightly still down but it's been mostly standing up today so I think it'll follow the other one and stay up soon.",

    "I would like to get a Border Collie for my next dog. I think they are enchanting and I can't help being amazed by them every time I see one. I'm doing my research on the breed even though it will be years before I'm ready as I have two little monsters I have to turn into model dog citizens yet! Im hoping some collie savy people can give their opinions.\n\r\nWhen I get the dog my requirements would be that it is mainly going to be a pet, but will do obedience training and agility once or twice a week and may compete if good enough. However it is important to me that the dog has the right temprement to be trained as a PAT dog, and go into hospitals etc. So people and child friendly is important. It will also spend a lot of time being driven around in a special dog adapted van. My GSD loves this and its a trait the collie will need too. My other requirement and I know im asking a lot but is for it to be dog friendly as I want to enjoy walks again! \n\r\nCurrently got two girls I know if I had one girl I would be advised to get a boy, but with two girls I dont know if a boy or a girl would be a better fit!\n\r\nI would like to get a rescue and this might be a stupid question but would it be possible to tell whether the dog was working or mainly show or pet lines by looking at it? And what type do you think would be more suited to what I would want from the dog (i.e working/sport/show/pet etc). If you wanted a dog for these reasons would you go for a rescue thats older and is known to have these qualities or a young pup you can train and bring up to bring out the qualities you would want? And if a pup would you go for a rescue pup or go to a trusted breeder who produces dogs such a temprement. \n\r\nAnd can you tell me what the main personality differences would be generally between working and show.  I usually prefer working breeds of dog but wondered if a show/pet line collie would be more suitable for the people skills a PAT dog needs and a working collie might be more suited to a more energetic job rather than a hearts and minds job??\n\r\nOpinions an advise welcome please.",

    "Hi to all, I am new to this site and thought I would let you know my experiences with this breed. (From NSW, Australia)\nI have a beautiful 5 year old black Curly named Sturt.\nThis is a very loyal, boistrious, excitable and highly affectionate breed. From my understanding and experience this breed are extremely playful and full on. The curly takes longer to mature then most other breeds. They say up to 3 years, but my curly is now 5 and has only recently begun to calm down.  They are very strong willed and like to do what they want, the owner of a Curly needs to be a very stong person who has the ability to be the master otherwise this breed will walk all over you.\n\nPUPPY: Like all puppies this breed is quite full on when young, very trainable if you are firm enough with them, but the thing is, it is like the puppy phase never ends. My family have always had Golden Retirevers  and as an comparison Golden's are easier trained and they generally mature within 1.5 to 2 years. With the Curly, this is alot longer. They are very stubborn. My Curly is 5 and only settled within the last few months.\n\nNATURE: Sturt is very good with my children 8yrs and 4yrs. He has never hurt them intentionally.  Due to his large size, sometimes when he gets really excited he accidentally knock them over. Also due to his long legs they will often hit us or he will accidently scratch us when he is rolling over for a tummy scratch. They are definately a bit of a goof ball or aloof. always doing silly things.\nI don't know about other Curlies, but our boy is very skitish and does not take well to any loud noises, even a door blowing shut or something dropping on the floor.\n\nTEMPERMENT:The breed is very affectionate, they like to be with you ALL THE TIME, they  want to be involved with family activites. Can be very boistrious and excitable around visitors and strangers, which has been a problem for us in the past. Very good with other dogs.\nHas a very deep loud bark, only barks when people come near our house. Never barks when inside.\n\nCOAT MAINTAINENCE: this breed still needs to be brushed regulary. His curls are very tight and small, they are actually soft to touch though, not prickly at all. I find his hair matts easier then a striaght hair breed, due to the curls, the hair twists around itself and gets 'more' tangled. Breed is also prone to a hair loss issue of patchy bald spots, not sure of the cause, have not experienced this with our Curly. Need to wash or wet hair after brushing as does tend to go fuzzy or puffy after the brushing. In my experience, the breed do molt a 'LARGE AMOUNT' which I was suprised to see considering they have no undercoat. Don't be tricked into thinking they don't molt, because they do a great amount.\n\nDIET: we give a large breed dry food to him which has added glucosamine and condroidon. Breed has a narrow chest and I have heard that makes them prone to stomach distortion, so I break his meals into 2 half size meals morning and evening.\n\nEXERCISE: Only moderate level. Loves a walk, but not for too long, is usually tired within 30mins. He plays with the children for longer periods. Will only run short distances.\n\nAll in all, if you can get through the extended puppy phase and boistrious behaviour they deep down are a lovely, loyal and funny breed.\n\nI hope this covers some of your questions, I went through the same problem before I bought this breed. Not alot of infomation from actual owners of Curlies available online.\n\nps: lol, always getting asked if he is a labradoodle, I love telling them he is a purebreed Curly Coated Retriever as not many people know of this beautiful breed.",

    "@Branjo Snow Have you tried this on your own dog? If so what strength did you use, and were there any problems? I have avoided giving this advice for a couple of reasons.\nFristly, Tear staining is strongest in the corner of the eye, so you would need to be certain that none of the peroxide was going to touch the lens or the conjunctiva. As many pet dogs are touchy around their eyes, this could be risky.\nSecondly, Hydrogen Peroxide is widely available over the counter in three strengths, 3%, 6%, and 9% volume. Personally, I wouldn't risk trying either of the higher concentrations in case they caused the hair to break off. (I have read that this can also happen with lemon juice, another common method). I would rather have a touch of pink than risk a brittle patch of hair.\nI have tried diluting the 3% v down to 1.5% v, but found that no better than Diamond Eyes, which I know to be safe. It is not a serious enough problem in my case to risk further experiments, but am always ready to learn.",

It's really doing my head in not knowing how he's doing etc. I've been told that he's living in the Whitley Bay Area of Tyneside and I've posted loads of messages on facebook groups in that area.. any help would be really appreciaappreciated.", 
    "When you think that every dog in the UK should by now be microchipped, I can't see how you could possibly trace Gizmo this way without knowing the number.

As he is a trimmed breed, you could try contacting all the local groomers but, harsh as it is, I suggest that you might be better to just accept the fact that Gizmo now has a new owner, and trust that he is settled and is having lots of care and attention. I don't want to sound hard, but otherwise you are going to make yourself ill with worry.\nHis present owner may well not respond if they suspect that you might be regretting your decision. I once rehomed a former show dog of mine. I had used him to produce two litters, and when someone who had had one of my puppies said that a friend of hers was looking for an adult Cavalier, and it would be a super home, I decided to let him go to where he could be a special dog. I got updates about how he went to work with his new Mum, a hairdresser, and was a minor celebrity for having his long full ears washed in the salon, and how he sat under the drier while they dried, but I never had any contact from his actual owner.\nI left it several months before I phoned her on the dog's birthday, and was surprised that she appeared to resent my call. Whether she thought that I was checking up on her, or maybe she even thought that I was wanting him back, who knows? I never phoned again, I knew that he had a happy life, and realised that I would have to be content to leave it at that. I hope you will be able to have another dog when the time is right, that you will love it as much as Gizmo, but next time be able to keep it for life.",

If the dog was rehomed complete with his papers, the new owner is likely to have had his details transferred to their name & address, so no conflict would be apparent.\nIn this case, Chrissy is trying to locate Gizmo without knowing his chip number.

Plus only Local Authority can implant and register microchips and only they can then register the chips under the ID number of the owner of the owner of the dog with the Ministry of the Agriculture.  And any transfer of a dog has to be done legally via the Min of the Ag.\n\nAnother advantage if is a bitch is spayed or a dog castrated, the Min of Ag will pay the private vet x amount if the animal has been spayed or castrated.  Which means that the vet can charge less if he or she wants to.  Most do not.\n\nIt is the same with dogs who have not had their mandatory rabies shot. A dog who has no chip therefore no rabies shot [which are also registered with the Min of Ag when [if] given], has a maximum of 5 days in the pound if picked up.

    "Hello,\nWe have a 1 year old male bichon and we\u2019re having problems with him being hyperactive to the point where I cannot play with my own kids because he is interfering. My husband and I aren\u2019t even able to watch tv together on the couch at night because he is constantly jumping on and off the couch, chewing things, crying to go outside every 5 minutes even though he\u2019s already been out a million times, and doing anything else in his power to make sure we are engaging him and not relaxing. If we try to ignore him, he will furiously bark and cry which we can\u2019t have, because this is going on at 10pm when our kids are asleep. When we finally crate him for bed, he barks and cries.

Dogs do tend to get bored with their own back  gardens, and walking, sniffing and playing in different areas will always tire them more than mooching around in their own space.

Progressive training can help a dog to develop impulse control.\nHave you tried getting your boy to engage his brain more? This can be even more tiring than physical activity, and depending on the age of your children, there would be the opportunity for them being involved in games such as tracking each other, - or searching for treats or toys - which can be done either in the house or outdoors. There are lots of tricks that you could teach your boy, allowing him to earn a portion of his daily ration in rewards. Dog trick books are available, also quite a few puzzle toys for  dogs, where he would have to work out how to discover a treat.\nIf you have already tried some of these methods without any improvement, I would ask your vet to do a blood/urine profile to rule out raised thyroid levels, or any other physical reason for his hyperactivity.",

    "hi all.My bichon Barney is a nitemare for scavenging anything & everything to eat regardless of what it is.We are very careful to not leave anything lying around but on the odd occasion when our 20yr old daughter leaves her room door open he's straight in there & always finds something I.e face wipes,left over food bits etc..Up until now he always manages to clear the objects from his body somehow until yesterday that is.\nSince 11pm last night he's been extremely unwell with shock fever salivating crying unable to get busy or eatAfter spending his day at the vets they said they could see an obstruction but didn't think it was foreign body,they sent him home without solving the problem which we find very odd & unsure of what to do now as he's clearly still struggling.Theyve suggested taking him back tomorrow for another X-ray", 
    "Hello again. My breed is also very greedy, and will eat all kinds of rubbish - given the chance. Your boy sounds very uncomfortable, and I hope you will have more positive news about him tomorrow. Paws crossed, do come back and let us know tomorrow's results. Good luck.", 
    "Please find another vet asap Theresa.  Face [and baby] wipes can and do cause obstructions, not only in dogs but in main sewers because they are not biodegradable.  \n\nTaking another Xray will not help because if your boy has a bad obstruction in his GI tract causing him so much discomfort and pain, the obstruction needs to be removed asap.\n\nAnd PLEASE tell your daughter to clean up her bedroom and close the door.  She is not a child.",

    "I take it that you are upstairs and the kitchen is downstairs. Could you not arrange for her to be nearer to you - perhaps a crate in your bedroom, or one just outside the door?

    "so i have a beautiful little bichon frise named Bonnie. she is so fluffy and white, but parts of her including her tear stains and around her mouth are very hard to keep white. when i take her for walks her feet will also get very grubby. she suffers with eczema, and has quite sensitive skin. \n\nmy question is how can i keep her fully white and what products would be friendly to her skin?", 
    "Our last Bichon passed away a few years ago and my hubby was devistated, He was an adopted 12 year old bichon, and a great dog and hubby's best friend.\n\nYesterday, I get a text message while at work, and there's a puppy in my living room.  A 14 month old Bichon, yet to be named, laying there on the floor. An adorable pile of fluff.\n\nBut alas, I did not know he was purchasing a puppy, and I have never cared for a puppy before that was this young and I have some concerns.\n\n\nFirst of all, how long can it take for a puppy to get acclimated to it's new home? He is not eating, barely urinating (never outside when I take him before and after naps/sleep/etc).  He does not seem to have much energy, and just wants to lay next to someone constantly, or just plops down on the ground when you try to walk him.  I believe he is teething because he kept going after my watch band and when he plops his butt down outside, he literally picks flowers.  No eating of the flowers, just bite, pull, spit.\n\nThe seller also gave us the dog food he was eating while in their care, but he won't touch it right now.  I've done the dry dog food they provided, after refusal to eat that all day, added a tiny bit of wet dog food on top to see if that would help, and eventually stuck a treat in it to try to entice him more, but he took the treat and a bite of the wet dog food, spit out the dog food and gnawed away on the treat.\n\nAccording to his paperwork, he has his 8 and 12 month shots, and they noticed he was itching at his ears a lot, so they/we have him on precautionary ear mite treatment, but he is also just generally itching all over.  I have seen no sign of fleas and his skin does not look dry, but I plan to take him to the vet this week just as a precautionary measure to verify the seller's information and get a second opinion on his general health.\n\n\nUnfortunately, he seems to have some separation anxiety due to whining unless he's touching someone and I do not know how to humanely take care of it, because I don't want him freaking out because I refuse to give in to the anxiety, but I don't know how to deal with it.\n\nPersonally, I love dogs, I want/ed another dog, but feel Hubby jumped the gun and purchased this one pre-maturely and I know I am going to be the one taking the most care of it, and I refuse to say \"You bought him, he's your problem\" because I love dogs too much, but any tips and assistance would be helpful.", 
    "Hi Tim - welcome to you and your new dog.  Look forward to hearing his name when you choose it!\n\nI'm a bit confused about his age.  You mention teething, but that he is 14 months old.\n\nBut anyway, if he only arrived at your new home yesterday, he's bound to need a few days to settle.  If he is 14 months old, do you know his history?  When you take him to the vet, he/she will be able to comment on the itchiness.\n\nAs you know, Bichons are gorgeous little dogs, and I am sure that very soon you will be pleased he is a member of your family!", 
    "He's not a puppy. At 14 months he is fully mature, but he is very confused right now and obviously feeling insecure. It's been a major upheaval for him which time and patience will help with.\n\nHe does need a vet check to see what is going on with him. The itchy ears may be an indication of an ear infection or more generally allergy, but your vet should be able to advise on that front. \n\nGive him a couple of weeks to settle in and in the meantime try to relax. The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed he will be and that will enable him to settle in better.\n\nGood luck with him x",

(I'll give you the link at the bottom.)\n\nAww poor baby. He must be missing his mama and siblings a lot, glad to hear he is getting a lot of cuddles.  Being off his food is a totally normal thing Harper my ESS was the same for the first couple of days. Its just a big change for the little thing, also are you planning on weaning him onto another food or are you sticking to the breeder's?\n\nTypical of a new puppy \"sitting on its bum when on a walk\" he's like saying I ain't going anywhere. Keep the encouragement going walks will be a big thing and at the moment he does not like his old routine being interrupted. They do start to enjoy walks after a while. Remember if he is scared pick him up and walk him past it showing him its safe.\n\nThe whining isn't typically separation anxiety it's most likely to just be, he's used to having someone next to him all the time like another brother or sister. (It does stop)Having a puppy for the first time is extremely hard and I don't think anyone on the forum will disagree with me.

    "well, Come to find out from the vet visit, he has Coccidia and a pretty bad yeast ear infection in both ears. That explains a lot of the whining.  This morning, he had much more energy, still had an accident on the carpet, but his potty times are anything but normal for a puppy.  in 48 hours, he has peed once and has not pooed at all.  \n\nI've tried pheromone sprays and scented potty pads to try to at least get him to pee in areas we can control inside, and to attempt to get him to pee outside, but no luck.  Went for a half hour 'walk' this morning and sprayed down a couple trees and sign posts and got him to sniff, but no luck. He is starting to show more energy at times but is still a lazy little fuffybutt.\n\nPut the tiniest dab of kong PB on his coccidia pill this morning and took it with absolutely no problems, and have been watching veternary videos of how to properly clean his ears with the medication and flush we were given.  Not looking forward to this one, because I'm always afraid of causing him more pain, but it looks simpler than I'm giving myself credit for.\n\nIf anyone has any more tips, I'd love to hear them.

    "\u00ab on: Today at 11:36:37 AM \u00bb\nQuote\nMy dear fellow bichon owners \nReally need some help and advice. \nMy bichon has been giving me and my wife so much of stress. It's only 2 of us in the house and we do try as much as possible with our busy schedule to take him out to exercise.. We somehow manage like twice a week walking him for 30 minutes around the neighborhood. And on Sundays we take him for an hour of obedience class.. He does really well in class and everyone days I have a wonderful obedient bichon and that I should keep training him till competition on level \n\nWe are crate training him and take him out at 5.45 in the morning to do his business but sometimes he has already peed in the crate and when we take him out he poos. \nThen we have to wash him and wash his crate and he is watching us do all this before we feed him in crate.. Then we put him back in crate t for us to catch a bit more sleep before rushing to work. We take him out lunch time and he pees.. At 7pm we take him out again and he poos but doesn't pee.. We bring him back in and feed him in crate again. Then he is given free time in the house and we do some short training and some fetch games in the house.. He only plays awhile and just stops when he feels and just lies down by himself and catches a nap.. We try our best to keep him awake pet him etc.. But he just lays down and doesn't move.. Then it's 10 PM and when we take him out to pee sometimes he goes but most times he just stands on the pee pad outside the house just being stationary . literaryly frozen.  Sometimes he even sits on the pad and we will startle him so as to not dirty himself \n\nWe do use words hurry up everytime we want him to do his business and he already is accustomed to the words. \n\nIt's as if he is not being let out the crate for long time and doesn't wanna do his business as he knows if he does he will go right back in crate so he is like buying time.. We are guessing. \n\nWhen we ask him to go home.. He seems tense and runs in to his. Crate and goes all the way to the back of the crate looking scared \n\nPlease help me guys", 
    "Dogs don't do things out of spite; they just aren't wired that way.\n\nThat sounds like an awfully long time for a dog to be spending in a crate......What, 18 hours a day??", 
    "Hi Bluejay.. Thanks so much for the Reply.. \nWell I know he is being crated long but it's not concurrent time and we both work so we don't have a possible solution to that for now.. When he is out and about.. He Marks around my house so we are trying to crate train as much to avoid him Soiling around the house.. What do u recommend?", 
    "I recommend more time outside and less crate time. No doubt he is extremely stressed due to all that time in a crate and so little exercise. He will be neigh impossible to train if you can't devote a lot more time to him. Not trying to sound harsh, but if you don't have the proper time for a dog, it is arguable that you should own one.", 
    "I'd be asking myself if I was really the best home for him too, to be honest. Three walks a week and a couple of hours out of the crate every day is really not much life for a dog; never mind something like a bichon, bred for companionship! \n\nCan you get a dog walker or a friend in? Break up the day a little more, provide him with more much needed exercise and stimulation.\nHow about dog proofing a room for him or having a pen, so he at the very least can have more space.\n\nCrate training really isn't the same as locking the dog away all day :/\nIf he is marking, rather than just weeing, then being crate trained likely won't solve that problem.\nHow old is he?", 
    "You don\u2019t say how old he is !\nThink you need to go back to basic housetraining\nIve never used crates or Puppy Pads and believe it prolongs house training,(if they are left all night without being taken out at regular intervals ) I had large cardboard box by my bed and alarm set for every 2 hours for first week\n\nThen every 3 hours after a week or so they would whimper if they wanted to go, yes it\u2019s a pain at first, but by twelve weeks old they slept through the night.\nIf he has to be crated at night\u2019 then you still need to take him out every few hours depending on age.(same applies during the daytime.\nIt would also be beneficial to him if he was exercised every day, 30 mins twice a week is not enough not only for his well being but socializing as well.\nIf you are unable to take him out during the day it would be advisable to get a \u2018dog walker, family member or neighbour to take him out at lunchtime for a walk.", 
    "Your post can only be a snapshot description, but Bichons are usually such lively little dogs, the usual complaint about them are attacks of the 'zoomies'! This motionless behaviour you describe doesn't sound at all typical. Do you think that it might be an idea to have a vet check him over and rule out any health reasons for it? \nThe other word that springs to mind is, 'institutionalised', he sounds as if he has learned to accept that his place is in the crate, and he is losing the motivation to interact with his family. You clearly care enough to train your boy, and to seek help on here, but I think you are going to have to think of some ways to make his life more fun. I think the other contributors are right, this has got to include a lot more socialisation, exercise and play.", 
    "Thank you thank you so much to all the feedback above.. He is 8 months old now and yes he really loves being around me.. But I get it now.. That's too much crate time and too little exercise... I am going to change all of this and see how it goes from there.. I will definitely feedback on the progress here.. Love u all", 
    "Here is a picture of my boy", 
    "He is a sweetie, I do hope you can solve his problems soon. \nHouse-training is difficult when you can't be with them enough to spot the signs that he is ready, and show them where you would like him to go. Try not to tell him off for making mistakes, that just creates stress, but let him know that he's done something wonderful when he does get it right. Give toileting a name - I say Quickie - and praise and treat every time he performs in the right place, or asks to go out. \nHopefully some better weather is on the way, and it will be more pleasant to spend time in standing in the garden with him, just waiting for the chance to say, Good Boy!",

    "Hello Everyone,\nI have a 4 month 21 day old Bichon Frise. He is a joy in our household. He is highly energetic and can be strong willed. My husband and I are working through this strong willed personality being careful not to do anything that will traumatize him. \n\nMy question is do any of you have experience with your Bichon occasionally spitting up yellow bile? My little boy occasionally does this and am starting to worry. Since it's not happening everyday or more than once a week, I thought I would check with other Bichon owners before I call the vet. Might this be happening because of his high energy? Should he be fed very early in the morning? I feed him about 9-9:30 am. He sleeps until 8:30 am. I take him to the pee pad between 3 and 4 am but this is too early to feed him. I put him back in the crate after he does his business and he goes back to sleep until 8:30 am. Any ideas?\n\nThank you\nmired",

I'm not sure I know what \"zoomies\" is but, if you mean running around at a very high speed, then yes, he does that. I've only heard some people refer to it as 'the bichon run\". This is a trait of this breed. I think they are adorable when they do that. \nHe's had this happen 3 times once per week in the morning. He doesn't appear to be sick after this happens. I feed him and some mornings he might or may not eat. He is not very food driven. Some days he will eat some breakfast and a little dinner. Other days he won't eat breakfast but will eat all his dinner. Last week he vomited in the morning but he ate his breakfast and nothing came up. I feed him 1/4 cup twice per day. He decides if he will eat or not.

I think this will be a question I will ask the vet. I may consider changing his food if it will not harm his tummy. \n\nYour feedback gives me more hope that perhaps changing his diet will resolve the problem. \n\nThanks much for sharing your story. \n\nBe well", 
    "As Carole has pointed out this seems to be a case of excess stomach acid, this can happen to all dogs not just specific breeds, when they stomachs are empty they produce  to much acid and making them sick up this yellow bile , as you are seeing.\n\nits difficult when they are not food driven, but I would space he feeds out a little more, try 3 feeds instead of two,  and then some form of treat, (piece of toast, biscuit )  last thing at night, before bed time, this hopefully will settle his tummy  and reduce the acid build up ,\n\nThe zoomies  is also a doggy thing, again not breed specific , mu boy still has his after his evening walk, he has to run his race track round the garden to finish it off.", 
    "You do seem to be doing everything right - including speaking to his breeder, so many people let this valuable source of information lapse. \nI think I would try him on a different flavour of food, as not all ingredients suit all dogs. Personally, I feed a grain free product, (no use giving brands as they are often not found in other countries), though paradoxically I still can't break the habit of giving them a biscuit at bedtime. Many dogs seem to appreciate fishy flavours, and Salmon and Potato could be a good alternative to try.\nAs Jackie says, splitting his ration into three smaller portions might help to keep his stomach occupied for longer. A tiny dose of human indigestion mixture might help when he does have acid, but do check to see that it isn't sweetened with xylitol, which dogs do not tolerate.", 
    "He's very young to be on only 1 meal per day. \n\nI prefer two feedings no matter the age, but definitely for a five months old youngster.\n\nFirst thing I'd try would be to split his meal into two giving one portion in the morning and one in the evening to see if that settles his stomach better",

My husband and I are working through this strong willed personality being careful not to do anything that will traumatize him.\n\nMy question is do any of you have experience with your Bichon occasionally spitting up yellow bile? My little boy occasionally does this and am starting to worry. Since it's not happening everyday or more than once a week, I thought I would check with other Bichon owners before I call the vet. Might this be happening because of his high energy? Should he be fed very early in the morning? I feed him about 9-9:30 am. He sleeps until 8:30 am. I take him to the pee pad between 3 and 4 am but this is too early to feed him. I put him back in the crate after he does his business and he goes back to sleep until 8:30 am. Any ideas?\n\nThank you\nmiredClick to expand...\n\nHello I don't have any answer for you on this issue but I am looking for any help on crate training.  I have a 9 week old female.  I bought her from a breeder and brought her home Monday May 22.  she has to have me in her sight.  I've had a crate in the living room and she naps in it just fine as long as i'm there when she falls asleep.  but I've been letting her sleep with me at nights.  I took her to the vet yesterday, required by breeder, and vet told me to establish the crate in which room i intend to keep it.  Put her in and let her cry.  Well this morning after she had her fun run outside i was drying her off and she was falling a sleep in my arms.  so i let her dose and then went to put her in her crate which i have in my bedroom.  the vet said i needed to leave her alone and let her cry and it could take even 3 hours.  well i think she finally stopped crying/barking, it took 2 hours.  I have a music station on my tv loud so she hears something.  I feel so mean.  do you have any tips for me?  Would value and appreciate any help!    Also my puppy was spitting up clear mucus just a couple of times and the vet said she's fine so maybe she just picked up something on the floors.  Hope your pupppy is ok!",

    "Hi all, \n\nI am looking for a good dog food brand which I can feed to my stubborn Bichon Frise's (2) and my older (14-year-old) cockapoo. I have them on 4Health, which they eat when they get hungry and now Fromm which they eat the same as the 4Health. I have them on the sensitive stomach 4Health I seem to be having a problem with my 6-year old Bichon, Toby, as he continues to vomit from time to time on the regular food. I want to feed them good food that is not real expensive. \n\nAlso, on a different subject, how do you go about trying to get a stubborn dog, again Toby, to stop barking when HE wants something on HIS time and not yours? \n\nThanks", 
    "Hi Glenn, it is difficult to advise on dog food brands as we have different ones in the UK. There are websites which rate the quality of dog food brands, www.dogfoodadvisor.com being one. Maybe one of our US, (I presume you are in the US), members will jump in with their favourites. In general terms, I would pick a grain free brand with a clearly stated protein source, and ingredients. You could always add a little meat to make it more attractive, some of the wet tray foods smell appetising. \n\nYou ask about Toby's impatient barking. I think I would start by teaching him the word Wait. Begin with very brief time periods, and ask him to wait for a treat, wait to go through a door, wait for his dish to go down etc. When he does that repetitive, 'hurry up, hurry up', barking, turn and face the wall until he completely stops, then turn and complete whatever you were doing. It shouldn't take too long for him to realise that the barking actually slows down the delivery of what he is wanting. Good luck.", 
    "Again, I'm from the UK so can't advise on dog food, but when he barks to get something on his time, you just have to make sure you ignore the bark and give him things on your time. They soon get the message if you are consistent. Dogs only do what works",

I will try the saline solution on a cotton pad and is if that works any better.  Thank you for your advice!!!"

    "I have just bought a bedlington puppy who comes from Granitor line. Mother is Granitor and father is not. I am not sure I really understand what Granitor means in term of physical look of the dog. I know granitor is a working line. But is it physically different looking from non granitor?\nI saw father and he is very cute. He is a show dog and a champion. But mother who is granitor was not groomed and only showed few times. She doesnt have the typical bedlington sheep like look. If I google granitor all I get is pics of working beddies chasing foxes  not the show type ones.\nAnd this puppy of mine is only half granitor.\nI hope I make sense. They got me confused with granitor title \n\nThx", 
    "Difficult to answer your question. Granitor is the affix, (kennel name), belonging to John Holden who is a Championship show judge of the breed. Any Bedlington bred by him will carry this affix, and could share some characteristics with other dogs from his kennel. \nI can only suggest that you put your questions on type to Beddy breeders who will be able to explain the finer points of certain bloodlines. The best place to do this is after the breed has been judged at one of the larger dog shows, or at a breed club event. The best way to stay in touch is through the breed club, The Bedlington Terrier Association. Visit their site for contact details.", 
    "Granitor is just a line of Bedlington Terriers. Granitor/Plashett is a pretty common line cross within the breed. Granitor/Gentleman Jack is another popular line cross. Granitor is a kennel. Their lines are popping up all over the world. Granitor Joker was a very popular stud. You should be able to trace all Granitor line pups back to Lukr Moon. Granitor dogs are KC reg and have been around for I would think something like 30 years now. They tend to be small, dogs around 15 inches, bitches 13.5 to 14 inches all with dark coats. The dogs are owned and bred by John Holden in the Manchester area. There are some photo's of Granitor dogs in 'The Working Bedlington Terrier Year Book 1998' and an article by John in the 1997 edition. Granitor Flint also shows up in a lot of pedigrees of Granitor dogs. The same with Granitor Lucky Man.",

    "Ooooo!  I can be the first person to put a post in here!\n\r\nI'm looking after my step-dad's 12 year old Bedlington terrier.   He's called Freddie and we've had him since he was a pup.\n\r\nHe's from the Honeymist line, but couldn't be a show dog because he broke a tooth on a toy when he was wee.  He could have been a stud dog (I've had people in cars stop to ask me howmuch stud fee I charge!) but he never got the chance  \n\r\nMy earliest memory of him is when our elderly neighbour got him and he would run around the garden looking like a rocking horse!\n\r\nHe's old now and stinky, but we love him", 
    "I've got three of them     The oldest one's 8, then one 4years and one 20 weeks.    The youngest one is a lunatic, into everything and so quick to learn!\n\n\r\nI'm curious, why do you think he's stinky?  Is it coming from his mouth?   or somewhere else?\n\r\nThey don't usually have a smell, unless they've rolled in something or been swimming ;-)", 
    "It's a combination of being on a rubbish diet (pedigree meat and mixer) and really bad teeth (caused no doubt by the rubbish diet).\n\r\nHe's actually owned by my step-dad so I'm working on him to get him on a better quality food.\n\r\nI've been looking after him while my step-dad is on holiday and he is much less smelly on his body.  I've not been giving him the Winalot biscuits he usually has in the morning or the Pedigree Dentastix.  Instead he's been having a dried tripe stick every morning.\n\r\nHe needs to go to the vets to have his teeth sorted, but I'm not sure about him having an anaesthetic as he is 12 years old.", 
    "Poor baby! Fancy feeding him on such rubbish - they probably thought they were giving him the best \n\r\nDoes he have loose teeth?  or are they all tartared up?  if the latter I'd be inclined to give him a bone (supervised) - nothing too exciting, a steamed stuffed bone which could then be stuffed at home - I use cream cheese/fish paste/even marmite at a pinch.\n\r\nIf his gums are red near the teeth or receding or teeth are loose, I'd get him to the vets, they would be able to tell you whether they could do it with just a sedative or if he needed anaesthetic    It will cost you tho, I had an elderly dog's teeth done back in the nineties and couldn't believe the cost!  \n\r\nI started my first Bedlie on Pedigree as a pup, but at six months her teeth were so brown and tartared I panicked and 'hit the web' (they were her new adult teeth)   I changed her to BURNS and gave her plenty of steamed bones and a regular raw chicken wing - I held the end of it - to chew and her teeth have been great ever since.   They're on CSJ now and still great teeth.  I find some dog foods better than others for teeth.  ;-) \n\r\nHope this helps him, it can't be much fun living with a stinky mouth.", 
    "He used to belong to my step-dad's elderly neighbour (she dies 2 years ago aged 91) and I guess she didn't know any better.  I think she never checked his teeth either.\n\r\nHis gums do look very red and sore, although they are mainly black in colour so it's hard to tell.  It's the back ones on the top jaw that are covered in tartar.  The bottom ones don't seem to have any.  His front teeth are pretty brown.\n\r\nI gave him a chicken wing this morning (my own dog is raw fed so gets them all the time) and he loved it!  Problem is, my step-dad is a vegetarian so he won't have chicken wings/bones/raw-hide in the house    \n\r\nHopefully the vet will be able to at least clean them up a bit",

Blue Lacy eyes are amber colored, almond shaped, moderately set with keen intelligent expression. Powerful jaws with strong teeth. Scissors bite.\n\r\nNeck\r\nLong, supple and well muscled.\n\r\nChest\r\nDeep and moderately narrow.\n\r\nForequarters\r\nBlue Lacy shoulders are sloping and set well back, well muscled without being coarse. Elbows well tucked in. Forelegs straight and parallel. Pasterns strong.\n\r\nHindquarters\r\nStrong, hipbones set well apart and stifle moderately bent, hocks low to the ground, showing galloping and jumping power. Well developed second thigh.\n\r\nLoin and Back\r\nSlight slope from croup to root of tail. Body lithe. Deep brisket almost down to point of elbow. Ribs well sprung. Moderate tuck-up. Back fairly broad, muscles slightly arched over loin.\n\r\nBody\r\nA correct American Blue Lacy should be perfectly proportioned creating the perfectly square, built for speed and endurance, appearance they are known for. Body length longer than height is also permissible. \n\r\nFeet\r\nOf moderate length, toes long and well arched, not splayed out; the whole being strong and supple.\n\r\nTail\r\nThe Blue Lacy tail is long, set on low and carried naturally in a curve. Tail reaches top of hock.\n\r\nCoat\r\nShort and glossy with lighter colored tips to each hair, very close and ranging from fine to slightly harsh with no feathering. \n\r\nColors\r\nBlue, gunmetal gray, red, and tri-color. A small spot of white on the chest is acceptable with white on the head, traveling up the leg, back or tail being a disqualifying trait. A common misconception is that Blue Lacys are named for the color of their coat. The name isn't\u2019t for their color but for the blue gene they carry. If the blue gene appears recessive to the naked eye due to the color of the coat, it still carries the blue gene as will be readily apparent by the color of the puppies when bred. This makes it irrelevant if they\u2019re blue, red, tri-colored or gunmetal gray as they all carry the blue gene and are still \u201cBlue Lacys\u201d.\n\r\nGeneral Appearance\r\nGeneral Appearance is one of grace, power and speed. The Blue Lacy is medium sized, of noble bearing with hard clean-cut lines-graceful, well balanced, very fast with free easy movement and alert expression. The whole appearance of this breed should give an impression of grace and symmetry and of great speed and endurance coupled with strength to enable it to track and chase down deer, wild boar or other quarry over deep sand or rocky mountains. The Blue Lacy expression should be dignified and gentle with deep, faithful, far-seeing eyes. Dogs average height at the withers is 17-20 for females, 18 - 21 inches for males.  Weight should be approximately 30 to 45 pounds for females and 35 to 50 pounds for males.\n\n\r\nDisqualification\r\nBesides size: any solid white spot on the back of neck, shoulder, or any part of the back or sides of the dog. Any white other than acceptable white: toes small amount on chest and very small amount on chin. Anything over or under height standard.\n\r\nBlue Dilution - D gene\r\nThis recessive gene has a diluting effect on both eumelanin and phaeomelanin.

We've started gundog training with him and having a few 'young' moments! Was going to post a new topic but as there's a Chessie specific post going: Does anyone have any good ideas how to stop him being a cheeky so and so and running off to play with other dogs when he's supposed to be working? At home and on his own his retrieving is getting really really good then I turn up at class and look like I've done nothing over the last week! He'll focus on the dummy and dart out like he's about to do the trophy run, picks it up then decides to completely ignore the recall and go and see all the other dogs sitting fairly patiently to heel. You can actually see him look at you when you call and think... naaaaaaaaaah! I'm off!\n\r\nEven a stay which on his own I can do for 5 mins or so in a group lasts about 4 steps at the moment!\n\r\nIf I walk off he will leave them alone and come back to me eventually but even then is reluctant to come close (can probably tell by my eye rolling that I'm not happy).\n\r\nI've tried being treat heavy and running round making as many excited noises as possible. Any other suggestions? Our trainers really good and is telling us it's a lot to do with his age but also understandably has to focus on the other dogs in the class. Chessies as a breed are known for their... 'obstinence' and a need for 'negotitation'. Anyone from experience know what they want?!", 
    "Hi Morganmarbles\n\r\nYour message made me smile - and brought back some memories!:-D \n\r\nJack isn't Gundog trained, but he did go to normal Training Classes ......... and was as difficult as yours sounds.  Cheese was always a good treat and would keep Jack interested for a little while.  I also find that it doesn't matter how exciting you try and make things, it just doesn't wash ..... Jack will do what he wants to do when he wants to do it one minute, then be the perfect student the next - even now and he is nearly 4.  \n\r\nSo.......... no really useful tips, sorry!",

Best of luck to you  \r\nOurs was going to be a gundog, but became very ill at about 11months and we very nearly lost him a few months later. It was touch and go, we had been discussing having him PTS as he had been suffering for a long time. Luckily, shortly after that he started to recover slowly and is now, at 4 years old a reasonably healthy dog.", 
    "ah well at least we arent the only ones.  He has very stubborn moments but he is still growing up so hopefully it will get at least a little better with time.  Cheese is one of Murphys favourites so he only gets his when he is training but still 9 times out of 10 the other dog is still more exciting!\n\r\nThat must have been a very hard time for you Alf, Murphy had an incident with a motorbike when he was about 5 months old and it breaks your heart when they arent in the best of health. You wouldnt believe anything had happened with the boy now!\n\r\nHope we can keep with the chessie updates, there arent many of us about!!!", 
    "Decided I need to get some control back over the goon so all the work I'm going to do now is going to be on the lead or long line so he can't get away with not doing as he's told. Lot's of heel work, short recalls, waits, distance sits and downs and reinforcement until he's back to 100%. He can have a short 5 minute run off the lead every day and he can be off the lead when I'm running with him on the beach (because he can't be disobedient there - I don't ask him to do anything but run! No arguements believe me!) Will let you know how it goes...",

    "Quick update, Murphs is taking to the discipline of the lead now though he was very grumpy about not being free early on. He's learning that if he's good the cheese is plentiful and eventually we see fit to let him have his legs for a bit anyway! Still to be tested with other dogs around but we shall see. I am definately going to be relying on the long line at the start! \n\r\nHe's done no retrieving at all while we're working on the heel work and I've even managed to get him doing a few distance sits as well (though not to the whistle and only in the garden with his dinner). He's a little grumpy still about it but I think he's coming round...", 
    "Had a fantastic training session last night. I was very worried because it started much as all the rest - with Murphs being uber excited and wanting to play more than train. After an initial run around the class when he was supposed to be heal-ing the trainer took a hold of him by the collar looked him in the yes and said quietly but firmly... \"NO\" The long line was put on and left to trail behind him. As if by magic the lights clicked on and the goon was glued to my side!!! We had three retrieves all with the long line on (as did the whole class) and for the first time in weeks... months... Murphs was finally top dog. He waited with one quiet command, went out like a dervish and picked up. On the way back he showed a bit of interest in trying to go to the other dogs but as the long line went taught he refocused and put the dummy straight in my hand! HURRAH! The long line will be staying on for a while longer now to reinforce things. The trainer has already said it'll drop off again before it gets better but I've got no bald patches from pulling my hair out this week! YAY!",

    "So brogan and I have found a local club to join, and have found a few trainers that use positive reinforcement rather than force-fetching after a little research and getting in contact with some people. The next club meeting is in the middle of April for a training day.\r\nFor now, we're continuing our fun games of fetch, and starting to get a little bit more complicated with it by trying to teach him to 'hold' his dummy, or ball, or wahtever it is I have him going after. The problem is, that he doesn't seem to want to hold anything, but rather drop it by his feet and try to tear it apart  \r\nI will tease him with the dummy until I see he's got interest in it, and then tell him \"hold\" when I know he will take it-then praise him. A second after he takes it though he spits it out by his feet, holds one end with one paw, and starts to try and rip open the other end.\r\nI'm sure the people at the club will be able to help me out with this, but there are very few people with e-mail accounts to get a hold of, and most of them are pretty difficult to get in contact with via telephone *sigh* so I was wondering if anyone here might be able to offer up some advice as to how to start teaching him to hold it a little longer?\r\nPerhaps he is too young? He'll be 5 months the 10th of April. Maybe I am doing this wrong? There's so much for us to learn. He is also starting to do this when I throw he dummy out for him-runs to it, stops to sniff it, doesn't pick it up but rather stands and begins to gnaw at it just as he does when I ask him to hold it.\n\r\nAny advice, as always, is much appreciated. Hope you guys are all doing well and that you're not too sick of me asking so many questions!", 
    "if this were my dog, and bearing in mind that he is very young, I`d not use a dummy ATM. Maybe a ragger or similar? So all the `mistakes` he`s making aren`t associated with the dummy. When you get the recall & hold right (and I first teach this by having a tug-of-war when the dog returns, so it rushes to get back) then introduce the dummy.", 
    "Thanks claireanddaisy.\nAnd I just realized that I posted this in the completely wrong section of the forum! I meant to put it in the gundogs section. Aye. I'm really very sorry! I need to learn to pay better attention to what I'm doing.\n\nWe have been using some other things-he's got a few nyla bones that he'll run after, a plush fox, but a tennis ball with a rope at the end is what we usually use. I only bring out the dummy once in a while, but it's not just with the dummy that he will stop to chew-it's with any of the above items.", 
    "If you stick with things you can get grab easily - a knotted rope etc., give it a good shake and have an exciting game with him. Hopefully he`ll find that far more fun than just having a munch. Then calm it down a bit. Don`t give him time to sit and chew it. And he shouldn`t have the retrieve toy unless you are playing with him. Remember he`s a baby and wants to have fun, which is great because he`s learning through play", 
    "I would say 5 months is a bit young for formal retrieve training. Really you want to start with the foundations first, at about 6 months old eg - heel on and off lead, recall, sit and sit-stay. \n\nTBH I would only try a few basic retrieves at 6 months, if at all, with a favourite toy, sock or rag toy and see how he does. If he doesn't fetch it leave it for another time and try again. If he does pick it up, but seems hesitant with it, try making a lot of daft noises and moving away, to make him come to you with it. Chances are being 5 months old he'll just leave the retrieve and run to you, but praise for the recall anyway! \n\nRemember he may be teething at this age and could be taking it out on the dummy - not a habit you want with dummies really. I started Isla with puppy dummy retrieves at 6 months and looking back it was way too early, especially for an English Springer! \n\nThere's plenty of time for retrieves in the future, my advice would be work on the foundations first. ;-)", 
    "Ripsnorterthe2nd, thanks bunches for the advice.\nI actually finally got ahold of the trainer who runs the retriever club in our area and had a good hour long conversation with him today-he told me the same thing. Not to worry about it right now, and to wait until he is between 6-8 months old to start getting into more complicated tasks.\nSo right now, we'll just keep it simple-stick with our puppy classes and fetch games, and always leaving our training sessions on a good note. \n\nI'm pretty excited as he invited me to a hunt test in our area on Sunday. Will be pretty fun to see all the dogs!",

    "Chesapeake Bay Retriever", 
    "Following is an article describing the Chesapeake Bay Retriever pulled from the website of Chesapeake Bay Retriever Relief and Rescue:\n\r\nChesapeake Bay retrievers are not related to Goldens or Labradors - and because of this very basic genetic difference, you cannot compare Chessies to these breeds. Chesapeakes are unique, intensely loyal, protective, sensitive, and serious dogs - traits that require thoughtful consideration before adopting a dog.\n\r\nUnique: Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are the result of crosses with Newfoundlands, hounds, setters, water spaniels and other dogs and were first recognized as a distinct breed in America in the middle of the 19th century. They were ducking dogs used by market hunters for retrieving waterfowl and protecting the day's catch. These early objectives in breeding and selecting for outstanding ducking dogs has endured in today's Chessies - they are still remarkably tough working dogs and loyal, protective companions.\n\r\nIntensely Loyal: Today's Chessie enthusiasts like to describe this breed as a truly all-around dog. The reason this can be is that Chessies are intensely bonded to their family - anything you consider fun they will try and work at liking it too. As Nancy Lowenthal has written, \"they make exceptionally good, quiet housedogs because they want nothing better than being with their owners.\" My dog, who loves water, will still hike to a water-less mountain summit with us and smile for the camera. Chessies are field champions, show champions, obedience champions, tracking dogs, therapy dogs - all because their owners thought to ask. Older Chesapeakes can bond very firmly with new owners; particularly if they have never had much attention. Consequently, Chessies need to be part of the family. Dogs always kenneled outside or tied up in the backyard are miserable. Chessies will not thrive, bond or work well under these conditions. A Chessie would much rather be crated inside the house. Another result of the Chessie loyalty is that they are indifferent to other people and dogs - very different from Goldens and Labradors.\n\r\nProtective: Chesapeakes are protective by nature. They feel a strong sense of responsibility to protect their owner's property - the yard, the house, the car, the children, the cats, the houseguests. Our dog even claims any isolated mountain summit we've climbed - she's very inhospitable (at first) to new hikers that join us - her form of \"planting the flag!\" As long as dog can be controlled this is not unacceptable behavior. Chessies must never be encouraged to become aggressive.\n\r\nSensitive: Because Chessies can be intensely loyal and bonded to their owners, they can be quite sensitive to their owners and members of his family. Once bonded to an owner and taught to respect that owner, a Chesapeake can be disciplined with a look or a low, sharp word. Over disciplining a Chessie can result in the dog \"shutting down.\" These big dogs require obedience training and must be kept under control - you must work with your CBR in a constant, steady manner to achieve a good working relationship. Chessies oftentimes do not work with enthusiasm for trainers other than their owners - this is where they get their \"stubborn\" reputation.\n\r\nSerious: Chesapeakes were bred to work hard and the modern dogs still thrive on work. Anyone who owns one should be able to devote at least 20 minutes a day either working, training, retrieving or playing with them. Chesapeakes that are not worked - both physically and mentally - are prone to mischief and will not \"think.\" Because of their love of water, 20 minutes of water retrieves is usually much more intense work than an hour walking around the neighborhood nicely on the leash. These active, intelligent dogs need jobs and responsibilities - it is best if you designate what these jobs are - you might not agree with what your Chessie decides is important!",

    "hi everyone ,\n\nmy bracco  had a full tail, upto 3 months ago when he banged it on a work top corner, and brock it clean in half, having to be rushed to the vets a 8 pm to have his tail amputated he was 2 yrs old when this happend not a puppy , has any one else had this sort of trouble, i'll always have my dogs docked in future", 
    "Some dogs can damage their tales sometimes George, though I think it is fairly uncommon and not a reason to dock as a precaution (unless your dog is an actual working dog).\n\nHave you got photos of you dog? I am a fan of Bracco Italianos", 
    "You can not have a puppy docked in the UK unless the breeder has proof that the dog will be used as a working dog in its new home. Though I still like to see docks on some breeds and I will admit that I do love ear crops on some of the bully dogs.\n\nI want pictures too, Braccos are one of the breeds I have looked at when I was trying to find a suitable breed", 
    "I trapped my dogs tail in car door as a pup but its still on. The vet has talked about removing 6 inches of it recently due to her keep popping the tip with her excessive tail wagging. Its murder as once it pops its pops really easy over and over and sprays blood everywhere. She wore a home made tail guard for a while made from a tennis ball till it healed. Hopefully she wont pop it again as i dont want any of it off. You will have a hard job getting a dog docked in the uk as the breeders have to have it done as its suppost to be done by 3 days old (or atleast thats how it is at my vets) the breeder must also have a gun licence and be a working breed of dog.", 
    "I used to breed Griffons a long time before the no-docking law came in.  And my pups were docked at ~3-4 days old.\n\nWould I do it now?  No way.  Although my pups squealed just while they were being held still, not because of pain.  And settled instantly they were put down.\n\nTails are for a reason.  I watch Pereg when she sees someone go past or come down the path.  Depending on the angle of her tail, I know she is telling me friend or foe or just get away from me.\n\nDog language yes, but also when understood, they are telling us humans what they think.",

    "BRACCO ITALIANO (Italian Pointer)\r\nTHE ALTERNATIVE BREED STANDARD\r\n(What the books don\u2019t tell you!!!!!)\n\r\nGeneral Description:\r\nThe Bracco Italiano is a hunting dog of ancient Italian origin.  It came over to this country eleven years ago on a Thompson\u2019s package deal and decided to stay.  He is characterised by his ability to melt your heart with a gaze whilst simultaneously removing anything edible from your pocket.  In general he is more suited to a working environment although he does quite like the sofa!\n\r\nGait:\r\nLong loping extended trot, nearly always in the opposite direction to that which you would like.  He has the ability to change direction suddenly thus defying any attempts to \u201cput him back on the lead\u201d.\n\r\nHead:\r\nA noble dignified expression; he is certainly too good for what is going on around him.  Ears should be long enough to dangle in his dinner.  Nose must be prominent with large nostrils to enable him to drink and blow water all over the kitchen floor simultaneously.  Head planes must diverge \u2013 although nobody seems to quite know where.  His mouth should be large enough to carry game - and a sandwich at the same time.\n\r\nBody:\r\nWell built and muscular enough to enable him to get through any door which is mistakenly closed against him.  Hindquarters (particularly in the female) should be slightly saucy.  Tuck-up should be frowned upon as opposed to \u201ctuck-in\u201d which Bracchi are exceptionally good at.\n\r\nFeet:\r\nLarge - certainly large enough to leave muddy prints all over the house and furniture!  Toenails (unless painted in the female!) should match the coat colour and be long enough to attract attention \u2013 particularly when placed on your foot!\n\r\nHearing:\r\nPoor - for the human voice, except at meal times.  \n\r\nEye Sight:\r\nExceptional; he can spot moving game (e.g. vole or shrew) at 800 yards.\n\r\nColour:\r\nDepends entirely on where he has been in the last 24 hours!\n\r\nSize:\r\nSmall enough to fit on your lap and large enough to put off other dogs without actually having to get involved in any unpleasant argy-bargy!\n\r\nMales:\r\nShould have two normally descended testicles and should enjoy watching all sports, going to the pub with their (male) owners and lolling about the house looking bored.\n\r\nFemales:\r\nShould have a cheeky expression and expensive Italian tastes!\n\r\n\u201cAny departure from the foregoing standard should not be considered a fault, is entirely understandable and will not stop you adoring your Bracco!!!!!!!!\u201d",

She is sooooo funny, a real comic and yet she is so gentle.\n\r\nI took her to the Highland Show last week and we were sitting having some lunch.  Ruby was going through all her \"tricks\" so she could get a bit burger.    A couple of toddlers came over and asked if they could pat her.  I said yes.  One of them - no more than 2 years old took her lead and started leading her around the grass.  Ruby just trotted along behind her good as gold.  I was very proud.  Here's some photographs of my baby.  She really is a very stunning dog - although I am biased.  She never ceases to charm everyone she meets.  She's a real star.  A true bracco!!!\n\r\nI hope you all like my baby.  Here goes!!!!;-) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nAnd here's Leap.  She is a friend's working Bracco Italiano.

I have an undocked Dobe, a docked Vizsla and an undocked Vizsla.\n\r\nI would love a Bracco but not fit and well enough to take on a youngster, would certainly consider an oldie though if one needed a home. Could only take bitch though as I have a Dobe male 5 years old and in his prime. Not sure if he would tolerate another adult male coming in, he does live with a male Lab, but my Lab is nearly 13 yrs old so he doesn't bother about him.", 
    "Hi there\n\r\nThe Bracco can be docked on undocked.  Ruby's dad is docked and her mum is undocked.  I personally prefer them undocked as it give more balance to the overall conformation.  Her dad is beautiful though.\n\r\nI think you are right about not taking in another male.  Although Bracchi are not a dominant breed, one of my friends had to rehome one of hers recently because of argy bargy with her old male weim so a bitch would be best.  As puppies they are not like other hpr breeds, they are very laid back.  \r\nYou sound just like me.  You have a real collection of dogs.

I spoke to Ruby's breeder at the weekend and she told me about the pups and that we should both have one.

  "Bernese Mountain Dog": [
    "Hello everyone. We have a 7 year old female Bernese Mountain Dog (approx 70 lbs). She's on Day 8 of hardly eating anything. I took her to the vet on Day 3 and they ran a blood test and she popped positive for a tick thing (annaplasmosis I think). So they gave her Doxy (an antibiotic) to see if that helps. I'm pretty sure she already had this tick thing many years ago and it just stays in your blood always though so I don't feel like that's it. She did also have a fever. Vet said to come back in 5 days if she's not improving. Fast forward to today and she's still not eating... she drools quickly on walks now.... and she'll eat a few scrambled eggs for breakfast maybe sometimes but that's it for the day. Today I measured out her water and she drank less than a cup of water all day. She turns her head away from almost all food and then threw up a few times today. I'm obviously taking her to the vet Monday but was wondering if any of you have experience with this? \n\nIn the past she's not eaten for maybe a day or was picky for a few days if she was stressed or in a new place, but this isn't that.

    "Thank you all for your comments. I wanted to give you an update and hopefully this may help someone else in the future. Called our old vet and turns out the anaplasmosis (tick disease) was something she had several years ago and so it always stays in your blood. So what is going on now isn't that, which is why the Doxy (antibiotic) wasn't helping. \n\nThe vet did an xray today and it showed a very massively enlarged spleen. Said she has cancer, most likely hemangeosarcoma. Just absolutely devastating. Symptoms she has are: weight loss (15 pounds since last visit 3 months ago), loss of appetite, fever, pale pink gums, and very few tiny pin prick looking blood spots on her gums, enlarged spleen, vomitting, and diarrhea. Just heartbreaking. The vet sent us home with prednisone and an anti-nausea drug. Unfotunately running more tests and doing surgery or chemo isn't something we can afford and it would also not increase her life by much. \n\nHard to believe that 7 years old is considered an older dog. Met a lady at the vet with a 12 year old dog. Happy for her but also hard that our dog won't live past 7. That said, Berners are just the most amazing companions. My heart just breaks. Thank you all for the support and listening. Means so much. Thank you!", 
    "All I can send and you and your boy is my love and huggles.  My girl, the one in my avatar, was 6 years and 3 months before we gave her peace.\n\nPlease do not let your boy suffer.  Just  love  him while you can.\n\nTikva and I will have you both in our prayers tonight.", 
    "So sorry.\nI think that Bernese have a reputation for having a short lifespan, but I agree, seven years should mean a veteran, but not end of life. I am sure that serious breeders will be trying to work on extending the lifespan of the breed - a difficult project as by the time a breeder is aware that they have a longer living specimen, it's breeding potential is already in the past, so progress will be slow.\nNone of this helps you and the decisions that you will soon have to make. Just be aware that most of us on Breedia have had similar decisions to make, and will understand if you need to unload. \nLove and sympathy, Carole & Beagles",

    "Unfortunately we had to put our beloved dog to sleep today. Absolutely breaks my heart! Even after being on pain meds and prednisone and all else, she still refused to eat or drink. Couldn't jump up on the couch anymore, didn't want to go on walks, her gums got paler / whiter every day. She was just done. It all progressed so fast. You could just see it in her eyes. She still enjoyed being pet but then there were times she just seemed over that too. She was just done. Just laid around and her stomach felt distended. It was the hardest thing making the call to put her down but it was the right thing for her. We didn't want her to have to suffer until the very bitter end. Keeping her any longer would have been for us and not for her, and that just isn't right. She was my first pet as we never had any as I was growing up as a kid. And while I always knew that some day our dog would die, I never really made that connection that I as her owner would have to be involved in making that decision. That's so incredibly hard and I'm definitely fighting feelings of guilt. If we had more money, could we have somehow saved her with surgery and chemo? Should we have waited to put her down another week? All these questions and no answers. At the same time though, there was never going to be a getting back to healthy for her. Hemangiosarcoma is just terrible. We didn't want her to suffer anymore and even if she could have made it a few more days, she would have had no quality of life. I have to remind myself of all of this through my tears.\n\nWe miss her so much and my heart just breaks. Walking into our house without her greeting us and seeing her food bowl and bed and all else around but her not here is just so incredibly hard. I'm a stay at home mom with little kids and our dog was just always my companion. She was there through all the mundane ordinary parts of life and she was always happy to see me. Happy to be with our kids. Just filled our house with this joy. She is so missed. Please hug your dogs for me. I'm hoping none of you have to deal with these terrible cancers. Life is a gift!", 
    "I am so sorry that the end has come so soon, Dotty. Be assured, you have done the right thing for your girl. Fortunately we are able to grant our dogs the painless end that many of us would choose for ourselves. I know what you mean when you speak of the sight of her belongings, it really hurts to have these relics, and no dog, but you will find that she is always there in your heart.\nOne day soon you will feel ready to have another dog in your life. I hope you will return to Breedia and share that news with us.",

I lost a girl in similar circumstances, from diagnosis to having to make that decision was just two days and such a terrible shock.\n\nBe assured that no matter what treatment you gave her, you would have gained little if any extra time. You loved her so much that you let her find peace and, hard as that is, it's the right thing to do.\n\nI, and so many others, really feel for what you are going through now. It's the worst of times, but you will get through it. You will always miss her and love her, but she will always be in your heart and a part of you. xxxx",

    "Hey everyone. My names emilie, I'm 23 years old.  I'm new here but I have a big problem with my little man. After a vet visit today with mister Nemo his specialist and I both confirmed what we were worried about. Nemo isn't gaining weight properly and is small for his age/growth curve. Specifically because of his diet and life so far. A quick recap of the story of Nemo, \nNemo is the runt of the litter a rescue dog of mine had. His mom was pregnant when I got her and gave birth 2 weeks later while she was only 7-8 months old. His mom was severely malnourished due to being rescued from a puppy mill situation. Before I realised his mom was giving birth (I was outside spraying down and cleaning the crates) she gave birth to nemos sister and Nemo on my couch. Except she buried Nemo into the cushions without breaking the sack and left him there. Immediately after she gave birth I was inside and making sure she was coping with the puppy that she had delivered,  after around ten minutes of me helping her Nemo caught my eye in the couch and I rushed over to help him, literally ripping the sack open with my teeth because I knew he had next to no chance of survival past like 6 minutes. I worked on him for 12 minutes before he finally took his first breath. Once he was okai I went to pass him to his mom to clean and she immediately snarled and snapped at him, luckily I flipped my hand in time to have her bite the top of my hand rather than him who was just the size of my thumb with a severly bowed hind knee and ankle hence the name nemo. I bottle fed him from the second he was born meaning he never had any colostrum or milk from his mother who continued to try and go after him every chance she got, luckily my other dog who was a rescue Pitt from an attempted fight ring took Nemo in as her own and protected him. He was diagnosed with fading puppy and given 1 week to live, he developed puppy pnemonia twice ans had to be weaned early due to his tendancy to inhale his milk rather than drink it. Fast forward 2 months and after my Pitt had a litter of puppies her old owner walked into my house with his unvaccinated dog/coyote I'm an attempt to steal them and gave them all parvo....  they went from perfectly fine one night to me coming upstairs to let my kacey girl outside and her being dead on the ground..... I'm not going to go into that subject more tho because I'm already bawling thinking about it.... fast forward another month and a half and after round the clock care in the icu and at home nemos finally made it and is a parvo survivor, after he continued to be I'll after overcoming parvo his specialist after I discovered Nemo has many allergies. He is allergic to all proteins but fish, he is allergic to grains, grass, any soaps, cinnamon, potatoes and go figure cats. Which immediately ruled out any large breed food and any puppy food as they don't come in single protein options. Sure fire foods that don't bother him as of now are fish, raw eggs, lactose, goats milk (not sure on meat yet) and he likes to chew on paper lol \nRight now I have no idea how to boost his caloric intake when he's always been free fed to begin with so I can't add more kibble. Not sure if anyone's dealt with this before or has any tips but ANYTHING helps.  Also sorry for the extremely long ezplenation.  There's just a lot that goes into why Nemo is how he is", 
    "Unless I've missed it, you don't say what breed Nemo is, how old he is, or what he weighs. Does he still have a malformation of the hind leg?\nIt sounds as if his mother knew that he was a fading puppy. Sometimes with the best of intentions we struggle a bit too hard to pull them through, and end up with a dog that has a lifetime of health problems. It is a pity that you didn't milk some colostrum from his mum, it might have given him some protection from parvovirus. I'm not sure why you are giving raw egg to your puppy, as raw egg white contains avidin which can cause a vitamin B deficiency, which could lead to further developmental problems. It would be better to lightly scramble the eggs and, as long as he isn't allergic to it, add a little cheese for flavour and added protein. We do have single protein grain free puppy foods in the UK, have you tried looking on one of the dog food advisory apps? Many firms are generous with their samples, so you could test some less common varieties like duck or pork. Alternatively, what about one of the ready prepared raw food diets that are available now - there are even fewer additives in these. They seem to be available as frozen nuggets, or in chilled vaccuum packs.",

    "I would go to the vet. There are too many possibles to make a guess, but she could have a raised temperature.", 
    "If you've spent any time around dogs, you know they pant. Panting describes a type of rapid, shallow breathing that speeds evaporation of water from your dog's tongue, and inside his mouth and upper respiratory tract. This is necessary because as his body temp rises, his skin doesn't sweat like a human's does. The normal (non-panting) breathing rate for dogs is 30 to 40 inhalations and exhalations per minute, but a panting dog can take 10 times that many breaths per minute (300 to 400). There are two types of panting: normal and abnormal.",

    "Hi all!\nI have a 1 year old male, who obviously loves his food! However, he is intolerant to most kinds. Mainly dry food but also some wet and even plain, cooked chicken! He's been perfect on Chappie, however he's now getting very bored of it and even mixing another tin of dog food in with it, doesn't help as he eats around the chappie! I don't think he'd cope very well on a raw diet, but just wondering if there was any dry foods I could try him on that won't set his belly off! He's tried Arden grange, James wellbeloved, Betta sens,  normal betta, Morrison's own... Pretty much everything from high to low prices. Just wondering if you've any suggestions?",

    "when you tried james wellbeloved was it the grain free or the regular ones with rice?  if it was a grain free one, which flavour?  He could have an intolerance to all grains or it could just be wheat, alot of the other foods you mention contain cereal in one form or another.\n\nSkinners do a gluten free working food, it contains grains but is wheat gluten free, they will send samples if you email them. If he still itches then it maybe all grains and not just wheat, but pick a protein that your dog hasn't had before such as Duck if he's never had that before. \n\nChappie also has alot of cereal in, it's usually the original tinned that vets recommend for upset tummies but this isn't much help if cereal is one of the things that he's intolerant to as it contains alot of them!\n\nalso check the small print (ingredients list) some may for example have fish and potato flavour but it contains chicken stock or chicken fat listed in the ingredients, if chicken is a problem for your dog.  The JWB grain free are good as they use single protein so the fish one only has fish stock.",

I feel so bad when I change it and it upsets his stomach as its literally within a few hours and you can hear his belly gurgling  he seems to be intolerant to chicken as I bought him some as part of his birthday present and it completely upset his belly! And that was just a plain, cooked chicken. I suppose its all trial and error but I may give the James wellbeloved another go. Ill also look at the Skinners you recommended! \n\nMany thanks!!", 
    "My girl is highly intolerant of chicken. Even the slightest amount makes her ill.", 
    "Chicken is a common allergen, yet for some reason I don't understand, turkey seems to be OK. Tinned meat can also a problem, because there are not many of them which don't contain, 'meat' by products, which is a euphemism for 'whatever we can get hold of', - unless you opt for one of the expensive brands, like Lily's Kitchen. \nWhen our vet started Eddie on test feeding, (for Colitis with bleeding from his lower bowel), she suggested that we start by avoiding all grains, and looking for a protein source that was new to him - duck, venison, pork etc. As we gradually introduced new ingredients, she said to allow six weeks on each brand. In practice foods containing maize clearly made him worse, so he only had about three weeks on the food which contained this. \nThough it may not suit all dogs, rice has never caused any problem for my boy, and I do use the Naturo tray foods, (from Tesco), as a garnish. They contain 20% brown rice, and always smell really appetising, especially the lamb and salmon varieties. I stick to grain free for their kibble ration though.",

Some dogs can be allergic to white potato but its more rare, but sweet potato is often ok. \nAcana do a Pork and Butternut Squash that has no potato in if you want to test if its that (if Skinners or JWB doesn't work) but its an expensive food think its like \u00a360-\u00a370 for 12 kg bag or something.\n\nJWB grain free isn't quite as expensive as in most places you can get it for about \u00a335 for 10kg, sometimes a bit less if you get 2 bags at once but still expensive considering can get Skinners GF duck and rice for about \u00a321 for 15kg! so maybe worth checking if its just wheat or all grains if budget is an issue cos it will work out much cheaper for you if its only wheat (and chicken) you need to avoid.\n\nJWB grain free comes in Fish, Turkey or Lamb (with vegetables).

    "Hello everyone, my name is Nicole. My parents fell in love with a 4 month old male bernese mountain dog only 2 days ago and could not leave the pet store without him. We named him Milo. I am away at school and have not gotten a chance to see him in person yet, however, my parents are worried they made an impulsive decision and that this was not the right choice. We have a 4 year old shih tzu, Max, who has been nothing but a joy in our lives and is an absolutely amazing, loving dog. He gets very scared and nervous around other dogs, but we thought giving him a friend would be beneficial for him. My parents are beside themselves with the reaction that Max has had since we brought Milo home. He will not eat, won't stop shaking, won't go to the bathroom, and is drooling from his mouth- he has never had this bad of a reaction to other animals and it has only been 2 days. My parent's knew it would be tough but they are getting very nervous seeing Max like this. As for Milo, he is absolutely adorable and shows so much affection already. Of course, he is just a puppy, but a much bigger puppy than we are used to. The house breaking is tougher than they thought- he has been chewing at our kitchen cabinets and has had so many accidents. I know it has not even been a week yet, but my parent's say that something does not feel right with this decision. They are aware that this is a choice they have made and are trying to come up with a solution to deal with it the best that they can. They knew that this type of dog is completely different than our Max in every way possible, but they did not think carefully enough about the impact this would have, they just loved him so much and wanted to give him a home. After researching more about the breed after bringing Milo home, they are worried about the demands of this type of dog. My dad is home all day long so we knew we would have someone to be with the dog all the time and work on the training, however, we are worried about the times that we will have to leave the dog. Although Max is not left alone often, it is not a problem when we do have to leave him alone for a few hours, or we are able to bring him with us wherever we go because he is so tiny and well-behaved. We are also not sure how we will be able to deal with the excessive amount of shedding, since we are not used to this. Also, we are very worried about damages to our house. Aside from all of that, we are mostly worried about Max because we would hate to cause any harm to such an important part of our family. This has been no light decision, but my parents are considering looking into finding another home for Milo (of course we would make sure he will be safe and loved before making any moves). I would never imagine my family to even consider going back on a decision like this because we have so much love for animals and it is truly breaking all of our hearts. We want so badly to give this a shot and hope for the best, but we are worried that the longer we keep Milo, these conditions may get worse. I am especially taking this hard because although I was shocked at the choice of dog breed, I was so excited and already loved the idea of having Milo as a part of our family (after only seeing him over facetime). However, at the same time I am sick thinking about the reaction of my dog Max and hearing the sound of nervousness and regret in my parents' voices. I am writing here to see if anyone at all has experienced any type of similar situation and I am seeking any advice that I can get. Thank You.", 
    "Sadly this story is all to familiar with people who buy on impulse and not choosing the right pet for their lifestyle ,also buying from a pet store encourages Puppy Farmers and Byb. Your parents have only had the pup a few days and are already struggling   This pup is going to grow quite large and if your parents are struggling now they may not be able to cope later on, so do what\u2019s right for the pup and rehome it, either through breed rescue or rescue centre.", 
    "I am taking it that you live in America & not England with you saying your parents bought the pup at a petshop.\nI agree with Vee if the pup is to much for your parents then look at giving the pup to breed rescue home [Bernese Mountain Dog rescue home] they will find a loving home for the pup with someone who knows all about the breed & his needs.", 
    "I was really sad to read this post. A four month puppy of any breed which is bought from a dealer is likely to have missed out on a great deal of socialisation, and is bound to take longer to adapt to living in a house than a puppy bought from a private breeder. This is magnified if the puppy is a large breed. If your parents feel unable to commit to training and socialising this puppy, it would be better if they put this impulse buy down to experience, and  let the Bernese MD Rescue find a home for him as soon as possible. \nBuying from a dealer perpetuates the puppy farm and backyard type of breeder. There really is no substitute for seeing a prospective puppy at home with his mother, and having the breeder's advice to fall back on. Whatever you decide, I hope Milo has a happy life.",

    "@6JRT's My Eddie had just this sort of start in life, so there is a good reason why I have such strong feelings about dog dealers. I have found out that his breeder is licensed for 108 breeding bitches, and 12 stud dogs. The mind boggles at how any council could think that number of dogs could possibly receive adequate care and attention. Ed was imported through Stranraer, and sent to what I can only describe as a dog supermarket in the North Manchester area. He was sold at around 12 weeks, but due to his first owner's health problem, he was only in that home for a fortnight, before being taken to a rescue centre, - which is where I found him.\nAs you will well know, these puppies arrive in rescue confused and under socialised. They have absolutely no knowledge of what is expected of them in a domestic environment, and often have hang-ups, (Eddie could not bear eye contact - the supermarket?), and building their confidence can mean having lots of setbacks along the way. These places will eventually be banned - the sooner the better in my opinion.\n\nPS. I have a friend who had a few petshops, (did not sell cats or dogs). I know that a local council inspector did the inspections on her premises. I'm not certain, but I think he could have been a Public Health Officer.",

    "Hello-\nI need some intell. I currently have three Bernese Mountain Dogs. I have a mom, she is 6, a dad, he is 6 and a one daughter, she is 4. I have bred the \"mom and dad'\" before. I have AKC papers for all of them, all of their puppies- most didn't care about the registration paperwork. Here is my dilemma, I wanted to breed the daughter. I was in search of a male. I found a beautiful, healthy and energetic the \"perfect\" male, in my opinion. We talked about breeding him with my female. He didn't want a stud fee, he just wanted a puppy- okay. That works. So now after speaking with me more thoroughly, he isn't sure if his male is registered and he has no paperwork on him. I am concerned for many reasons. My main concern is that he could potentially not be registered with the AKC, and I have always registered all of our puppies with them. I know a lot of people in my area constantly stop by or call and ask if we have a litter yet- most don't care about the registration. I am worried though, if I don't register these puppies, people won't want them. I need to opinions- and maybe options- that I go through.",

    "I have owned two of this wonderful breed.\nMy first Ollie unfortunately had underlying health problems and we had to have him put to sleep at 41/2 years old.  We thought it was a sudden thing when his back end went on post mortem it was discovered he had several rare and incurable diseases which we then were able to relate to his what we thought was laziness or stubbornness when younger and his dislike of other dogs nearby as he grew older and his shyness with strangers.  He loved his family very dearly though.\nMy boy Ollie in his healthier days.\n\n\n\nI am now owned by a very busy energetic almost 28 month old Bernese called Dillon.\nAs a breed they are a little complicated with regards to training they can be very silly and can take between 2 to 3 years to mature mentally some longer I fear Dillon is in the latter category.\n\nThey were and still are in some places worked and their tasks could range from being in the mountains watching the flocks,  they are not meant to be and were not bred to be guard dogs but watch dogs and to alert you to strangers.  They have been used to herd cattle if you walk a Bernese especially off lead they tend to zig zag and this is their herding instinct and how they work and of course how most people see them  at events pulling carts.  They would walk steadily beside their master delivering milk round the villages.  They can give the impression of being plodders and as they get older they do slow down but some youngsters can be very busy and they can take off at speed but do tend to expend their energy quickly and then need a rest but a healthy Bernese will be up and doing it again after a few minutes rest.\n\nThey can be very stubborn and think for themselves which can make training a bit of a challenge as they are also very sensitive and will dig their heels in if treated harshly or shouted at and can with draw into themselves.\n\nThey get along with other animals and people but can be a bit over the top in their greeting and if you have small children do need to be supervised they can be a mouthy breed and also boisterous and although not intentionally mean to knock over or bite they can bruise the skin badly they have a mastiff type jaw and are classed in the Molasser breed.\n\nWith consistent training they do get over this but they can teeth till around 2 years of age the teeth when through can take a while to settle into the jaw.\n\nThey do need grooming at least two to three times a week and more in the Summer to remove the undercoat.  They are also susceptible to heat stroke.\n\nIf you are house proud this is definitely not the dog for you they shed heavily in the warm weather love being out in the cold and rain and snow and are generally mud magnets even if not intentionally.\nThey can also drool most don't but some do my Dillon does especially if food is around.  He has loose flews not uncommon in the breed but they are meant to be dry mouthed compared to Newfoundland's and St. Bernard's.\n\nIf you work all day probably  best not to get this breed neither of mine have suffered with separation anxiety and can be left up to 6 hours on some occasions but not on a  regular daily basis.  They love to be around their people preferably on their laps or curled up next to them on the sofa and also if not on the bed in the bedroom at night.\n\nWhen growing exercise has to be watched free running on grass is better for them as they can rest when they need and short lead walks till around 18 months at least.  Some can have a high prey drive and the odd Bernese has been known to chase livestock,  I feel not with intent to harm but more wanting to play but none the less if you feel your Bernese may chase then keep him on harness and long line so he cannot stress a farmers livestock and it all ends ups a sorry state of affairs.\n\nThey can have many health issues so if considering this breed do your research and ask the breed club for a list of breeders.  At the moment the only health tests the breed club expect their breeders to adhere too is Elbow scoring and hip scoring they would like to make it compulsory for breeders to swab test for degenerative myelopathy too but as of yet I do not think this is compulsory.\n\nSo if after reading my life with a Bernese you feel this might be the breed for you and you are prepared for hair possible  slobber and drool lots of training some tears but mostly laughter and in the case of the males a 100 pound + lap dog then go ahead you won't regret it.  You may have days when you wonder what you have done but for the most part you will not regret having had the chance to share your life with this wonderful breed.\n\nJust to add the Bernese will let you think they are a bit slow on the training side of things but don't be fooled they are an  intelligent breed they just don't see letting you know  is helpful to them.\n\nMy loveable sometimes exasperating boy Dillon.\n\nEnjoying playing with friends.\n\n\nPuppy days.\n\n\nLittle and large.\n\n\nDillon aged 2.",

    "Same here the Bernese Mountain Dog is known as the Berner sennehund hope its spelt right and the Newfoundland Landseer is the black and white Newfie.I had a newfiexberner but she was not known as  a loughlander just a bernerxnewfie.Have you tried the internet and typing in loughlander.Mine was an    accidental mating which breeder will make sure never happens again..",

    "doodles said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nHiya,\r\nBernese Mountain Dog but with throwbacks to Newfoundlands.Click to expand...\n\nBernese mountain dogs originate in Switzerland. In the early part of the 1900s numbers went into decline and the breed was nearly extinct at one point. As far as I am aware, a newfoundland was used in the breeding to increase numbers and to re-establish the breed around the late 1940s. Any 'throwback' would therefore be to one dog many many generations ago and would probably be unlikely to crop up often (if at all) these days. Certainly, no-one would be able to guarantee such a 'throwback' (ie, a purebred Bernese showing definite Newfie characteristics) would occur in a litter, much less advertise them as a breed. Indeed, Bernese breeders are breeding to produce good examples of the Berner breed and would not wnat to produce dogs that showed obvious traits of another breed. On the other hand, I suppose you could say that all today's Bernese are throwbacks to Newfies as almost all lines will trace back to the one Newfie introduced to the breeding all those years ago. Still doesn't make them a different breed though! Incidently, St Bernards (another Swiss breed) also had Newfies introduced into the breeding many years ago when the breed was almost wiped out in Europe by distemper. What would Switzerland have done without the good old Newf?   \n\r\nI would suggest that if someone is indeed advertising a 'Loughlander' as a Berner with throwbacks to Newfoundland', what they probably have is a crossbreed or poorly bred Bernese Mountain Dog.", 
    "Would agree with that and I remember our breeder telling us that in the 70's the Bernese in some cases not all were showing uncharacterstic lines being slightly agressive and the Newfie was introduced into the breed to stop that and bring the Berner back to its original temperament.So ocassionally it is done delibareteley to make sure the Breed stays as it is meant to be placid.If any one is advertising a newfiexberner that is exactly what it is a cross breed.There is not necessarily anything wrong with that if it is accidental and they are not expectiing you to pay the equivalent for pedigree Berner or Newfie,and it is a one off.", 
    "Hi Doodles\n\r\nI've never heard of Loughlanders either and I've been involved with the breed since the mid 70s.  Many of our UK Bernese breeders did happen to own Newfs too and there were a few cross bred litters reported through the decades but none of these were officially incorporated into the Bernese gene pool. \n\r\nI've never heard of a name given to these crosses except for one breeder in Abergavenny, East Wales who attempted to establish a new breed, calling them \"Welsh Mountain Dogs\" just a few years ago, using Bernese, Newf and Border Collie (or was Welsh Sheepdog?) blood.  Her website is no longer up so I can only suppose that her plans fell through.\n\r\nThe introduction of Newf blood to the Bernese gene pool that Shaynlola mentions was in the 40s in Switzerland and is thought to be an accidental mating that was then used to improve temperament as Zantababy says but only the one mating was offcially incorporated into the Bernese bloodlines.", 
    "Loughlander is actually a name that has been given by some people to a cross between a Bernese Mountain Dog and a Newfoundland. They then had BC added and were called Welsh Mountain Dogs as previously mentioned.",

Thanks", 
    "From waht Willowish has said, a Loughlander is NOT a breed, just a name given by someone to a cross of two breeds....might otherwise be known as a mongrel or a mutt   but that probably wouldn't entice someone to part with huge sums of cash   \n\r\nReputable breeders of both breeds (Berners and Newfies) would be horrified at the idea of crossing the two although, as has been already stated, the occasional accidental litter does happen but they would be sold as such...an accidental cross and would not have a pretty name attached to try to disguise the fact.\n\r\nBernese Mountain Dogs are known to be prone to certain diseases. I believe hip dysplasia, osteochondrosis of the shoulder and elbow,ectropian/entropian, trembler (hypomyelinigenesis) and elongated soft palate are the most common.\n\r\nNewfoundlands also are predisposed to Hip Dysplasia, heart conditions, elbow dysplasia and cystinuria among others.\n\r\nReputable breeders breed to try to ensure as far as possible that their dogs will not be affected by these hereditary diseases and test accordingly. I would doubt that anyone deliberately crossing the two breeds would be quite so diligent. The thought of producing a litter that could suffer from some or all of the aforementioned problems doesn't bear thinking about  :-( As someone with an interest in both of these wonderful breeds, I am very glad that I have never heard of  'Loughlanders' and that there does not appear to be many deliberate crosses produced   \n\r\nIf you like the two breeds, why not look into each separately and go to meet a couple of breeders (or to a show) and see if one or the other appeals to you. That way, you can be sure of the dog that you will hopefully be sharing 10-12 years of your life with",

If not, I'm afraid that the chances of your pup remaining healthy are decreased rather than increased.\n\r\nHeart testing in the Newfoundland is of particular importance as there are a couple of conditions that they are prone to (sub-aortic stenosis & dilated cardio myopathy) and which will seriously affect quality of life in a pup who has inherited one or other. Indeed, in the case of one of the conditions, affected dogs are unlikely to make it beyond 3 years of age :-( If you have no idea that the parent dog (and other dogs in the line) tested clear, then I'm afraid you'll just have to cross your fingers and hope for the best.

    "I'm researching into which breed my lifestyle might suit. I've written more about my lifestyle in the general dog chat, but was just wondering if anyone had more specific information on the Bernese. I adore these dogs, but not sure if I'd be suitable for one. \n\r\nI'm a first time dog \"owner\" - do you think I could cope?!\r\nHow much daily exercise are they happy with?\r\nHow do you find them to be in the house? (I've heard contradictory information, some saying they are calm adults, others saying they are as energetic as a springer spaniel!).\r\nWhat are the general difference between the males and females?\r\nDo you think/find their big size to interfere with where you can take them? Eg popping round to friends, to the pub etc\n\r\nThank you for any advise", 
    "Hello Alice and welcome to Dogsey.\n\nI have owned 2 Bernese one unfortunately no longer with me and now I have a 4 month old puppy.\n\nFirstly re: exercise in the firstr year of their life you have to be very careful because of the frame size and joints the 5 minute per month rule is worth adhering too.  IE: 4 months old no more than 20 minutes exercise.  Possibly on fields not pavements on a harness and long line to make sure they do not go off to investigate dogs which may be wanting to rough house or nasty.  Negative experiences with this breed when young can have a life long effect.  Not good to deal with when they can reach 10 stone in adult hood.  So socialisation is a difficult one but can be achieved under careful supervision.  They can be a slobbery breed depending on the breed lines and they do shed tremendously.  They are not an energetic breed in the hot weather you have to be careful they do not overheat so walking early mornings  and late evenings is best in the summer months.  You will probably find they do not need the amount of exercise they do in the winter.\n\nBeing a working breed they can have a stubborn streak and do need a lot of entertaining when young to keep them out of mischief they are also a very mouthy breed and do need to learn bite inhibition very early.\n\nThey are great to take to friends and the pub if your friends don't mind hair and slobber.  They are very food orientated so easy to train in that respect but you have to be mindful of the weight they pile the pounds on very quickly.  Males and females the difference is size really they can both be stubborn and the females quite hormonal when starting and during seasons I have only owned males but Dillons breeder remarked on this when I was considering a female this time around.  They are a loving breed and need human companionship as they were bred to be working beside the farmer most  of the day pulling carts around the village.  They were when not doing this a flock guardian so they can be a little territorial especially the males if allowed to get away with things.\n\nIt will be worth looking at the Bernese events which start in May the Garden party (Roade Northampton) where you will see an abundance of Bernese all shapes and sizes and plenty of people to talk too and meet the dogs.  You do not have to be a member to turn up and wander round and a good breeder will be more than happy to discuss the breed with you and their lines.\n\nMy first Bernese was ill from day one we did not know this till he became very ill and was hospitalised then PTS and a post mortem caried out he was 41/2.  He came with many issues one of them  being nervous we had to adapt our life around him he did not like strangers in or out of the house some he would accept not others it was very random.  They can be shy but with the right socialisation should not get like Ollie.  He was socialised from a very young age but his problems were as we found out too late medical so whatever we did we could of not of cured it.  We loved him though and he loved his family.  This breed do not do well if rehomed after 18 months they become very attached to their humans so you need to make they are the right breed for you.\n\nThey do come with many health issues.  Cancer and joint issues but many do live into double figures so again researching breeders is paramount but things can and do go wrong even from the top breeders and it is nobody's fault.\n\nHere is a link to the Bernese club of GB.  worth a look if you haven't looked already.\n\nhttp://www.bernese.co.uk/\n\nSouthern Club.\n\nhttp://www.sbmdc.co.uk/links.htm\n\nhttp://www.bmdinfo.org/\n\nHope these links are of some use.

I find Basset (our BMD) much more socially needy than other dogs I live with.\n\nBasset has been fairly inactive, and in his youth was happy with between 30-60mins of exercise a day. In his old age now (9.5) he can only cope with 5 mins or so due to severe arthritis. \nAs Lynn said they are prone to health issues, and ours has been no exception so I think insurance is a must and it is something to bare in mind that your life with them is short but sweet. \n\nNot the breed for me due to their large size, slobber (which is not too bad compared to dogs like mastiffs, newfies etc) and inactivity, however temperament wise I think they are LOVELY.\nBasset is the nicest, most easy going, friendly, well tempered dog I have ever met. He loves people and other dogs. Nothing phases him, he is bomb proof. \n\nThey love their food which helps with training. \nAs for first time owners, they can be strong minded and hard to house break (say some - including us!) Basset is very food motivated but will not do anything he cannot be bothered. I'm not sure how easy they would be as obedience dogs based on my experience with them.\nMy buhund is much more eager to learn and please in that respect. Having said that he was my parents first own dog and all has gone very smoothly.\n\nThe size is not really an issue - Basset goes to pubs, shops (he is allowed in all sorts of places like video stores just because people love him).

    "Hi Alice\n\nI live on my own and work from home also. I used to have a Bernese - he died aged nearly 12 a couple of years ago. He was not free of health problems (epilepsy, heart condition) and I was lucky he lived to a good age, I know that's rare. He was extremely affectionate and did need a LOT of company. I had a Newfoundland and a Leonberger as well but I did always hate leaving him more than the others when I had to go out because he needed me more than they did. He had to be in the same room as me all the time, or at the very least where he could see me. (And as a puppy, wow, was he destructive!) He definitely required a lot of attention but in IMHO I would not say he needed children around. What exactly would a child give him that I couldn't? Unpredictably screaming, running around and knocking into him accidentally?! Not having children means my dogs don't share me with anyone. By saying they need to have children around maybe the breeder is just testing your resolve? Breeders have their ways of testing whether someone is serious.

    "hmmm...not a hybrid, its a cross breed.", 
    "Some call crosses hybrids, same as you get hybrid vigor in dogs and other animals.", 
    "I often wonder why people continually undermine the credibility of their views by using incorrect terminology which then begs the question \"how much do they really understand about what they are doing and why\"?\n\r\nAnyway, I thought from the title that I was going to be able to castigate a poster for the poor spelling of a nationality, but am now crestfallen that opportunity is not afforded me! \n\r\nThe jury is out where I am concerned........", 
    "just googled them...they dont do it for me. BMD are one of my fave breeds.\n\r\nA hybrid is something that is a cross of two species (Donkey x Zebra, Lion x Tiger, Dog x Wolf) \r\nA cross breed is where a species of animals has \"types\" or \"breeds\" (So Shire x TB, Labrador x Golden Retriever, Holstein x Frisian)", 
    "What annoys me is the assumption (which seems to be made a lot when you speak up against fad crossbreeds) that people would be against these kind of crossbreeds because they are purebred extremists and don't want \"their\" breeds \"tainted\" by being crossed. Since when does that have to be the only reason to be against crossbreeding? \r\nAlso if these breeders are so convinced that it's not a crossbreed, but a new selective breed of its own, why the stupid name? It doesn't need to be called a Labernese just because it's a Lab x BMD, call a French Service Dog or something that relates to its purpose/origins like other dog breeds, don't go along with the whole \"cute\" mix of breed names.\r\nI don't know either breeds well but I think I'd be wary of crossing the Lab, known for its fondness of fond, and a breed prone to hip dysplasia, with a heavy set dog like a BMD - ouch, poor joints!",

    "I quite agree Krlyr", 
    "I know a lady whose blind, and has service dogs.  Her first Seeing Eye dog was a Lab, she had to send it back... was useless, apparently. Her second was the afformentioned Lab x BMD.  who was the perfect guide dog (in her opinion)  he was brilliant, and she felt totally comfortable with him, and trusted him completely... unfortunately, he died young, due to a common problem with the BMD.  then she got a GSD, who died young due to Kidney failure.  Now she has a Lab x Golden, whom she likes alot, but he's nothing compared to her \"labernese\"... according to her.\n\r\nI dont believe in breeding dogs, unless there is a reason behind it, I dont care if it's a mutt or a purebred.  Unless there is a purpose for breeding the dogs, then there is no reason to breed... to me, it looks as if they have a purpose, and a good one at that... as long as there isn't another run on the designer \"Labernese\" and everyone and their mother begin to breed them (like the Labradoodle), then ok by me.", 
    "if there is a reason for creating a new breed (for example Goldies x labs apparently make better guide dogs, or even x'ing Huskies with Pointers to make faster dogs, dalmatians with pointers for health) then I have not a problem with it. So long as the x is throughly researched. BMDs are renowned for poor health, so I wonder why they didnt choose a breed with similar attributes?",

    "BMD's have poor health and a short life span... How does this help service dogs when crossed with a lab?\r\nBreeding 300 X bred pups a year seems a lot to me; I bet more than half of those do not make the grade either, and then the remainder of what is left, probably suffer with a health problem at some point and retire early.\n\r\nIf you have a dog that isn't right for the job, look at another breed IMO. Or breed fewer dogs, and look into taking rescue pups in for training? hmmm......", 
    "Being a Bernese person myself I do worry about the health problems of the breed and the hip and elbow problems also.\n\nCrossing with  Labs is worriesome as labs also have problems with hips.  As for worrying about labs being greedy Bernese can be too.\n\nI do hope a lot of thought and research has gone into this and if it has and it works for a specific reason all well and good.  \n\nI have seen some people jumping on the band wagon though two adverts on free ad sites UK advertising Labernese for \u00a3600 a puppy now this I do object too.",

When we got Ollie I did a lot of research on the breed and we went and met them in the flesh before making a final decision about this was the breed for us.  It is all well and good reading they get large especially the males but I felt we needed to see just how big and we did and we were happy we would cope with the size which we did.\n\r\nThe problem is I thought I had found a good breeder we visited many times no problems and we met both parents both hip and elbow scored and good temperaments and all the dogs had lived good long lives unusual for Bernese to live as long as some the breeder had.  In fact all the dogs we met had good temperaments we felt we had done everything right.\n\r\nI have learnt this weekend this breeder is not very well thought of and it seems I may of made a terrible mistake.  I didn't know then there was this person I could go to for advice and help I had never owned one of this breed before my last dog was a mongrel and we lost him early so we thought this was the right way to go in fact we had never owned a pedigree dog before  Ollie.  So when puppy contracts were offered meeting all the dogs including both parents seeing hip and elbow scores and the offer of if for any reason we could not keep him he was to be returned we thought we had done well.\n\r\nI am now feeling  sad and unsettled about it all after what I have learnt.  Of course we wouldn't of changed Ollie for the world even with all his problems and I still feel he was meant to be ours because no one else would of understood him or dealt with his issues and later his illness like we did and still love him.  Thats by the by now done and gone and nothing can change that.  \n\r\nSo after all my waffling sorry, how do you people that breed and are into buying pedigree dogs know you have found a good breeder I have some pointers but am feeling overly cautious now.  I have been told not to buy from breeders with a website advertising puppies.  Makes sense but I am a little suprised I know about adverts etc., and although tempting would not buy a puppy through those channels anymore than I would from a pet shop I have learnt a lot since joining Dogsey.\n\r\nI have been told not all people on the KC accredited breeders scheme can be all they seem to be.   \n\r\nI have been given 3 numbers to contact out of a choice of 6 I had made thinking I had done well this time obviously not.  I had whittled them down. \n\r\nNone of these people advrtise you get to know through knowing someone.  All well and good when you know where to ask etc., but what about if you don't ?\n\r\nDo you feel this is right or am I being overly cautious ?  I know even through good recommended breeders you may still have some health problems after all the breed has a lot I am not naive about that but this time I would like to feel I  have done everything right and maybe have some more time than I have had previously.\n\r\nI know its a minefield and I think I needed to get my worries off my chest and see what you thought if you have managed to keep up with this waffling  thread.", 
    "I dont understand the bit about the breeders advertising on their websites (or do you mean on pup selling sites?). Many decent breeders will advertise puppies or their plans for the up and coming year on their website, on the KC site, and CD. Most will have waiting list, but sometimes people drop out or are not liked by the breeder on visiting, theres more pups that avarge born ect - so breeders have no other option than to advertise. I wouldnt worry to much about where you find the advert (to a certain extent) let that be for a pup or for the plans of a mating - its more important that you 'vet' the breeder. \n\r\nYou can contact breed clubs, and look through breeders on CD & you could also visit shows. (even if not wanting a show pup!) Visiting shows are a good way of meeting breeders within a breed, seeing their dogs out of the home enviroment and talking with them possibly planning a litter.\n\r\nYou are very right in saying that all breeders on the ABS are not all that - but things are changing and improvements are being made..They have started 'home checking' breeders and about time to I believe..even if a little late..we have been on the scheme for a number of years now, but only recieved our visit last year - so it is going to take a while to weed out the not so good, and even then I believe some unethical breeders will remain as it will be impossible to rid all.\n\r\nwe all look for different things in a breeder but for me I (ideally!) would look for the following in a breeder;\n\r\n- A breeder that has bred for a reason, with an aim for the litter (this comes down to me not being in fav of breeders, breeding soley for a pet market..However a pet breeder might be something you have no problem with) .\n\r\n- One that fully health tests their dogs.\n\r\n- One that doesnt have more than two (at the very most) litters a year.\n\r\n- One that can guide you in any area with your pup, always offering you support and advice, taking dog back if needs be and just generally being there to call upon.\n\r\n- One that will question you, and answer your questions - openly invite you into their home to meet a few times with breeder and fur family.\n\r\n- One that has a good understanding of their breed and own dogs, can offer you lots of advice..Give you good and bad points.\n\r\n- One that does KC register their puppies, DNA profiling would be an added bonus - being members of breed clubs is also something to look for, but not the bee all and end all.\n\r\nThere are aload more things but my minds gone blank..as long as you feel you have brought a well cared for pup from a loving home, where (in your eyes) the right ethics have been followed then you cant go wrong.\r\nThere will aways be people in breeds that frown upon some breeders for X and Y reasons, this doesnt make the breeder bad, if you feel they have been up most responsible in caring and raising their dogs.\r\nOnce you have found a breeder you like the sound of, just contact and chat with them - you get a feeling for people.\r\nAlso typing in the breeders name/affix can bring a whole load of stuff up on the internet..something that can sometimes make good reading.\n\r\nI am not sure if their is a breed related forum - but that might also be somewhere to go for a wee bit more advice?", 
    "Thanks DD for the reply.  The bit about websites and advertising litters is because the gist of what I was told was in this breed they should not need to advertise. ( Not the ads sites).  That I know is definately not a place to go.\n\nHence my confusion too if like me first time around you do not know this how do you know differently.  I'm not entirely sure this is something to take as seriously as I felt it was intended, but I will err on the side of caution and go with the advice given.  Given my previous experience.\n\nLike everyithing you do your best and hope it all turns out well.  But most things are lottery at the end of the day and they did admit even the really good breeders have at some point had the odd dog taken off their legs at a young age for no apparent reason.", 
    "have you contacted the breed club(s)?\n\r\nThis is the FIRST place any potential purchaser should go in search for any breed puppy. Members have to abide by their codes of ethics/conduct and the secretary can advise you, generally speaking they are not biased.\n\r\nPupppies, like children, do not come with any guarantees.  If you feel that the BMD is the ONLY dog for you, then all you can do is the best you can.

    "Hi Lynn  \n\r\nFirstly, you mustn't blame yourself for what you've heard about Ollie's breeder, from what you say I would have thought you had researched really well.  Also, in all breeds there is a certain amount of back-biting, so maybe also take what this other lady has said with a pinch of salt ;-)\n\r\nOllie was a darling boy and gave you so much pleasure, what happened to him could have probably happened to any dog, I'm sure.\n\r\nI do know that Rachel has a friend with a Bernese, it may be worth pm'ing her to see if she could find out the breeders details etc., and whether she would recommend her.  Word of mouth is very often a good way to find a good breeder.\n\r\nI haven't got any shows booked other than English Setter ones for the forthcoming weeks, but as soon as I go to an all breed one, if there are any Bernese there I will see if I can ask about them.  I have a few catalogues from recent shows that will have owners details in them, I'm more than happy to post them if you wanted to phone the exhibitors and ask questions. I'm sure they wouldn't mind, I get loads of calls every week asking if I have any pups, if I can recommend breeders and generally asking advice.  I think most people that love a breed so much are always willing to help others.\n\r\nI am an Accredited Breeder, and I do things by the book, but I do know of others in my breed and other breeds that don't do what they should be doing so you are correct to assume that it doesn't necessarily safeguard you.\n\r\nIf only you were after an English Setter I would be able to help you immediately   xx", 
    "Thanks Sheree.\n\nIt is a minefield it was hard enough when looking for our first Bernese (Ollie) it is even harder now.  I think there are so many now going into rescue more than they would like through bad breeding that she is understandably very passionate about it.  Rightly so of course.  You can find them on the free ad sites now some KC registered some not all varying prices and some with hip and elbow scores and some not.  Also various cross breeds.  Of course those I would definately not give our money too and encourage them to keep breeding.\n\nOf course there are good and bad in all and I am sure most of the breeders on the Accredited scheme do it by the book but I suppose you will get the odd ones in all breeds who don't its the finding out who do it right that is the problem.  But like you say even the  recommended breeders sometimes have problems.\n\nSB summed it up very well nothing is guaranteed and I agree with that 100% and will not lay the blame for Ollies problems directly at his breeders door she has some lovely dogs and some into their teens so she must of been doing something right.\n\nOllie was destined to be ours I feel very strongly about that.  Fate if you like he was going to need us and he got us and although we have and me mostly have had my heart broken it was worth every second he has taught us a lot so when we get our new Bernese baby we are even better prepared.\n\nThank you for the offer of the show magazines they would be good to look through and make some enquiries I will pay the postage.  Also the offer of if you see any Bernese people at shows asking around for   me.  We will be attending the carting show at Northampton in May to get to meet some people and get a feel for some different types.\n\nI certainly feel more positive today about putting my best foot forward and finding our new addition.", 
    "Hi Lynn, sorry only just skipped through this thread coz I'm in a hurry atm, but there is a very reputable breeder in my village (Findon), and a lady with one who is hiring my van shortly, told me via e-mail that the dog she recently lost actually came from this breeder, and the dog was 11 years old and from what you have said in the past, I consider this to be quite a considerable age for these dogs? They have been on her waiting list ever since losing that dog, and only recently (a month ago), she was contacted to say she could have another puppy.\n\r\nI don't know this woman (breeder) personally, but I've seen her dogs being walked, I know she shows all around the country (coz I bought her car off her many years ago), so I've met them, I've been up to the kennels, and can only say they seem to be very knowledgeable and pleasant people to deal with, but I was only buying the car lol!\n\r\nI think her mother used to breed them, but now the daughter and her husband have taken over. Shall I get the contact details and pm you, or if you like, I'm sure the lady who is renting my van would be more than willing to converse with you via e-mail or phone if I contact her?\n\r\nLet me know Lynn and I'll do all I can to help you get in touch with them.

Not something I was about to tackle on my own.\n\r\nAnd in answer to the question    no I wouldn't own another Bernese, primarily because of the poor health record but also, I now prefer the more independent character of the spitz and other breeds.\n\r\nThanks for the comments on my dogs",

    "Good morning everyone, \n\nI had a general question for the community regarding your dogs coats/skin! My Akita kuma just turned 5 months today and the other day we noticed he had a skin tag pop up on his snout about an inch under his eye. Naturally, this concerned me so I took to the internet to see if it\u2019s normal and what not. Which led me to a skin condition called sebaceous adentis (probably misspelled). Some of the pre cursors are a stiff coarse coat. And on our kumas back he does have long black and brown coarse hair. I originally thought they were guard hairs.  I asked the vet about it last month when we went in for his rabies and finishing up of shots and he informed me it was just his adult coat. Do any of your dogs have anything similar? Is it anything I should be potentially concerned about?",

    "good morning everyone,\n\nJust had some general questions about your guys experience with your akitas as pups. My girlfriend and I recently got our first Akita, but we\u2019re no strangers to large breeds or the Inu family. She raised and bred Bernese mountain dogs and I had Shibas through my childhood and young adult years. His name is Kuma (I know not original, but fitting) he\u2019s about to be 4 months old in a couple of days and we just want to be sure we\u2019re doinf everything right and address some of his behaviors with the community.\n\n-what we do: walks 3-4 times a day for about 15-20 minutes. Training 3-4 times a day for about 10-15 minutes. All kinds of socialization, take him to petco/petsmart weekly, goes to the dog park about 1-2 times a week, try to keep him around people frequently. as far as training goes he knows sit, stay, down, heel, and leave it like the back of his paws (inside with treats, were transitioning training to outside and more distracting areas)\n\n-what he does: so this is the naughties... with my girlfriend he tries to hump her, but when she stands and tells him to sit he does. He is a bit of a biter (we tried the ow! Thing), and he loves to look at us bite something he knows he\u2019s knows he\u2019s not supposed to.. stops for a second when we say \u201ckuma leave it\u201d then goes crazy running around and repeats the process a few times. \n\nAre these behaviors normal for a near 4 month old? And is there things you guys can recommend? Thank you tons!", 
    "The biting will ease if you keep being consistent. 16 weeks is the age when baby teeth start to come out and new teeth push through and, just like babies, it's a bit of a sore time for them.\n\nYour girlfriend could try giving him something to do after giving the sit command, be that a game, a bit of training or whatever. This way he is both rewarded for doing as he's told and then his mind is taken away from the humping to help stop the behaviour. \n\nPuppies love to test the boundaries, but it seems you are doing pretty well at letting him know what your boundaries are.", 
    "Hi Anthony\nAny pup at 4 months old is going to behave just as you have described. We have an Akita, he is 13 months old now,so, I understand how difficult it is to deal with some of the behaviours given his size\nWe overcame the biting/mouthing after a while ( even now he still tries, but, you can tell he knows it\u2019s wrong and stops himself ) \nHow we did it... we had many of his toys scattered around and every time he went to bite/mouth we put a toy in his mouth, he would then hold onto it whilst you fussed him.\nAfter a few weeks we found he had worked out what was expectaed of him.\nNow, when we come downstairs on a morning or come through the door from being out, he goes himself and grabs a toy, he then comes over, we command \u201c sit \u201c and that\u2019s the time we fuss him\nJust a thought for you, we never ever play \u201c tug of war \u201c with him and if he has his toy as I have just described we don\u2019t try to take it off him\nIt has worked for us and it\u2019s worth a try \nWe regularly tie a thick sock or rope into knots and tuck a piece of his kibble into the knots, that keeps him entertained for a while. Watch out for him nibbling the material though you don\u2019t want him eating the fibres\nThis is Yoji at 12 months old saying \u201c good morning \u201c to my sister with one of his trusty rags. \nIt really has calmed things down.

    "My Akita (Luna) has been losing weight more and more since she turned 1 in November. Loose to runny stools constantly for three months, she was just dropping the weight. I tried the whole rice and chicken with zero difference to her, I tried switching kibble again no change other than the color of the poop. She was a muscly 64lb now she is 55lbs and a spine you can feel easily and her butt bones you can feel.\n\nShe's been at the vet a few times and every time the poop tests came back negative for parasites.

Tomorrow she goes for a blood test to see if it is EPI, I did a some reading and its apparently quite manageable with the right enzyme supplements. I found a very reputable site called enzymediane.com who specializes in the particular enzyme for this deficiency.\n\nTo me she seems to tick all the EPI boxes and I was just  wondering if anyone has had any experience with EPI before?", 
    "In the past I had a Golden Retriever dog, Merlin, who had EPI. In those days the test was done on the faeces. He did not have diarrhoea as such, but he would do several motions on a walk, and each one would be looser than the last. When his poo started to look clay coloured and his bottom was a little greasy, we decided to have him tested. He also tended to have a dry flyaway coat.\nThe vet put him on Pancreatin capsules, which were instantly successful. They were quite expensive in those days, so after a year or so, the vet suggested that we could try using a cheaper but narrower spectrum drug. This also worked for Merlin, and is what he stayed on for the rest of his life. \nHe died at 11 with heart/lung disease, I believe unconnected to his pancreatic problem.", 
    "Sorry to hear about your girl, its quite common in Gsd  did the vet advise \u2018fasting\u2019 (no food for 12 hours prior to the cTLI, B12 and Folate test.blood test )\nThis is the best place for info\nhttp://www.epi4dogs.com/apps/forums/\n\nthis is there facebook page also\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Epi4Dogs/",

I lost a Husky a year ago to something I still don't know what it was, I just had those helpless feelings all over again ya know?\n\nThe Metronidazole must be taking effect though because she didn't poop at all last night, before she would poop more often than she pee'd. I'm just lucky the weather here is like Antarctica at the moment, I'd have zero chance of picking that up in the summer let me tell ya. I have to let those little cow pats freeze first lol.\n\nI am kinda bummed though that its probably going to be for the rest of her life, but I love her to bits and I would sell the shirt on my back to keep her healthy.

    "I have a tough decision to make and wondering if anybody has experience with this. I have a 7year old female Akita(Reiko). I got her from an awesome breeder in Indiana as a family pet. She is fixed and grew up for her first 2 years with a male Akita, (Cujo) since Cujo died she has been the only pet other then a outdoor cat which they actually get along well. Unless the cat moves fast then it\u2019s game on, fun to watch, but never hurt the cat. Well the breeder we got her from had a 4 year old male Akita who needs a home. We are seriously contemplating but am worried about the potential issues. The Breeder did say she would want to take the male back if needed. 7 hour drive though. I trust the breeder with her description of temperament but still you never know. Anybody out there with input from experience would be awesome", 
    "Could you meet the breeder mid-distance, and allow the two of them spend some time together. Going for a walk on neutral ground is a very good basis for starting a canine friendship - you should be able to form a good idea of whether they might be compatible, and without the complication of a possessive attitude from the resident dog.",

I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do but am going to have to rent a SUV. I have a car and don\u2019t think sharing the back seat would be ideal for two akitas", 
    "I'm going to say this if no one else does, I don't think the potential harmful outcome is worth the risk to be honest. A new male puppy for example would be schooled by her and look up to her and develop a strong relationship, but an already fully grown male Akita is probably going to want to dominate her right off the bat, and if she's just as stubborn (which they all surely are) and not having it, then it could lead to a serious fight sooner or later.\n\nUnless this Male Akita is the model of friendliness and your female Akita willingly submits to him, then I honestly wouldn't take the risk. Four years is a long time to a dog, pretty hard to change any behavior that has had four years to set in, and can you really be 100% sure of his history with other animals or people/children etc?\n\nWhen they said they'd take him back no problems, it makes me wonder how many times he has been brought back already?\n\nI tend to err on the side of caution so my thinking here is how a teenage daughter would feel if you brought a teenage brother home one day and said,\" ok now you have to start sharing everything\".", 
    "All valid points Branjo. When I suggested a play date, I wasn't necessarily thinking of bringing him home the same day, (unless they got on like a house on fire). The fact that this girl has lived with a male before, and that he is from her birth kennel was what tipped it for me.", 
    "Harsh as it sounds you have to discount the example of Cujo, as Reiko was raised with him. He was most probably a father figure for her, he probably taught her all the ropes and checked her when she needed it like a parent or older sibling. Its unlikely she will ever see another male Akita the same way as she saw Cujo, and probably a lot safer for her that she doesn't.\n\nWhen I brought my Akita pup home my Husky tried to rip her out of my arms and most probably shake her to death, he had to be physically pushed into another room for her safety, and he was raised as a pup with a female husky 4 years his senior, she loved him to bits from day one.\n\nMy point is that even with his super positive relationship with his \"mother figure\", it played no part in his initial reaction to Luna, an 8 week old female. It took a lot of supervision for me to trust him with her. The fact that she grew to his size in no time at all helped a great deal too.\n\nAll I'm saying is if it were me, I'd get Reiko an Akita puppy to care for instead, it would be a lot smoother of a transition for her and a lot easier for you too in the long run. She would more than likely have the maternal relationship with a puppy that Cujo had with her.\n\nGood luck in what ever you decide, but either way we need more Akita pictures round these parts lol.", 
    "Hey and Merry Christmas to all also  I hope the coming new year will be better thn this one, for all around the world. \n\nI am trying to upload a video in order to show you our Arya\u2019s progress as now she is exactly 4 months old  \n(I hope video will be uploaded without a problem) she is now 17.5 kg but looks rather thin. I know being thin is way better thn being fat at this time of age, especially because of her hip & elbow joints. On the other hand I am curious about your lovely girls and boys weight and looks at 4 months old (if you can remember right ) she is taking walks 1/2 hour in the morning and 1/2 at night also she plays in our garden about 1/2 hour by herself also. She is on \u201cAcana heritage puppy for large breeds\u201d kibble that she enjoys very much. According to Acana\u2019s chart she\u2019s got to be eating 280-290 grams but she eats about 420-430 grams a day and she is still thin. She has her worm medicines and etc so there is no possibility about worms  ladies and gents do you remember how does your boys & girls weigh at 4 months ?",

    "Hello Umur - thank you for the latest pictures of lovely Arya  - I do not think that she looks thin, to me she looks perfect,  and as you know, slim rather than fat is far better for her health.  \n\nI do not know anything about the food you give her as I am a raw feeder but I am sure someone far more knowledgeable than I can advise you about that, but I do think that a lot of dog food manufacturers tend to just use a standard chart for the amount of food for dogs of a certain age and weight.  Only all dogs are different even if they are the same breed and same age, some needing more and some needing less.\n\nWhat does your vet say about Arya's weight?  Does she weigh the correct amount according to her size and build?  If you are concerned can you weigh her monthly to check whether she is gaining [or losing] weight?\n\nAnd how is she getting on with you all and with her training - please keep us up to date with new pictures and how she is doing!",

So I made a call to the breeder today and send the video and some pictures, he said she is in perfect condition from her looks. So I will keep her feeding program as it is. \n\nI was a Barf feeder for about 3 years but the process of making meat and veggies packs and freezing process made me go nuts  I was spending my 4 hours on sundays to make 10 day packs for 3 dogs.

The only problem about walks is every s\u00e7ent is new to her so we stop any&every new scent or visually new object in order to examine it thoroughly  she attracts lots of attention and I encourage people to pet him and give hugs in order to socialize her properly  so we are pretty good at daily schedule \n\nI will try to post that video again from the computer and keep you posted",

But I do not make it up into daily packs, I pack and fast freeze chunks of turkey neck or chicken wings individually so I just have to take one out of the freezer for the morning meal, which is given frozen.  Evening meals are meat [turkey gizzards/liver/hearts or ox lung] also packed and frozen individually, with a new pack taken out of the freezer to defrost in the refrigerator for the next evening, as I cut them up to mix with her evening meal [she is only a little girl but with a big appetite!] and for vegetables I buy kilo packs of frozen diced mixed vegetables - usually four packs at a time, one pack being put into five kilo size containers, each container holding enough for two days, with a new pack being opened every ten days. Like the evening meals, I take a container from the freezer to defrost in the refrigerator.\n\nThe evening \"wet\" meals have the necessary vitamins and supplements to ensure that nothing is missing from her diet.\n\nLast week I froze 2 kilos of turkey neck chunks, 2 kilos of chicken wings, and 2.8 kilos of turkey hearts, although the latter were open frozen on trays and then tipped into a large plastic carrier bag to pack in Pereg's freezer.  All done in less than a day.  About two or three weeks before I packed and froze 2 kilos of turkey gizzards, and the next lot to order, pack and freeze will be 2 kilos of turkey livers and some time later 2 kilos of ox lung.  I still have the remainder of previous orders in Pereg's freezer, plus some large frozen whole sardines, heads/fins/tails included and ungutted, also as a morning frozen \"bone\" meal.  The morning frozen \"bone\" meals and all the meat lasts weeks, so it is not a weekly thing for me to have to make up daily packs - it is 15-20 minute pack and put in the freezer whenever things are running low. \n\n\nI am weighing Arya weekly and so does our vet so she is gaining weight with no problem and not bulky amounts.

    "I\u2019ve never used puppy pads or newspaper as I don\u2019t see the logic in training pups to go indoors then expect them to go outside it just confuses them.\nSome puppies need to go out once or twice a night for a few weeks or more, others are sleeping through the night at a young age.\nIt\u2019s really important to prevent accidents in the house as much as possible while teaching to go outdoors. That means you need to supervise him very closely take him out often and encourage him to go and use a cue.\n\nFor the first few weeks I always had mine in big cardboard box beside my bed, and alarm set for every 2/3 hours for first week, working time up till they would whimper if they wanted to go. When they whined to go to the toilet it was a swift, out of the bed, downstairs, outside for a wee/poo, No playing or fussing or anything else.\nAlways took them in the garden after every feed, drink, playtime, sleep and used a command go toilet waited till they went and gave lots of praise, brought them inside as soon as they've done it.\n\nYou need to make sure that you remove the urine smell indoors.", 
    "I believe that observation is the key. My puppies go out immediately after every sleep, every meal, every drink, and whenever they begin nosing around in corners or near a door. Whatever the weather, (brolly by the door, and treats in pocket), I stand outside with the puppy until it has performed, then I join it in a joyful dance, and give a small reward for doing a Good Quicky or Poo Poo.\nThe last four that I have house-trained have been older rehomes, and I have found it useful to put a couple of small bells on the collar - mainly as a reminder in case I get engrossed in some activity. You can also get bells which hang from the door, which the puppy can nudge when he starts finding his own way there.",

    "Hi There,\n\nOur Akita X Malamute gave birth to 7 lovely Akita Pups 2 weeks ago. We had 8 but 1 didn\u2019t make it. Before Thursday just gone (26th Oct) all pups were fine. Then suddenly 1 started having Diarrhoea. We took him straight to vets where they gave him an antibiotic of  synulox via injection. He went back Friday for a check up and had another injection. Vet also advised to worm puppies straight away which we did with drontal (wanted panacur but couldn\u2019t get any from anywhere) diarrhoea still kept on with pup so we kept giving extra water and 2 oral doses of synulox. Unfortunately today 2 other pups have started having diarrhoea. Vet advised us to give them synulox as well and extra milk if they aren\u2019t gaining lots of weight.\n\nI should say that all pups are gaining weight and appear happy and have opening eyes and are walking around. Mum feeding and doing well although they have put on antibiotic as she felt very warm underneath. They wanted to to nip Amy possible chance of infection in her. Diarrhoea is not completely water. It\u2019s a bit thicker (mustard colour) and has some \u2018bits\u2019 in it. Has anyone had this before? This is my partners and I\u2019s first litter and we are worried. Please help!",

    "Dear ladies and gents, I have read the forums and before I ask my question I wanted to tell you a little bit of me and my family and the situation...\n\nI am 42 years old and my wife 39 so we are not a newly married couple. I had a four legged brother Sunny (a golden retriever)when I was 18 thn when he passed away at 15 years old, and I understood that I can't be without a dog... So we had our boy Loki (a dogo argentino) 3 years before our marriage with my wife  thn we get our girl Chyanne (a giant schnauzer) and 1 year after that we adopted a three year old stray that has leishmania (Lucky) as our second girl. Long word short, Lucky passed away this april because of her disease at age 8 and Chyanne passed away at 6 years old this july. So 2017 is a pretty sad year for us and Loki. Now Loki is 9,5 years old (neutered) and we see that he needs a sister because he is really sad and needs his four-legged pack... Since we are mother father figure for him (or alfas you can say) he really needs a pack. \n\n I generally took Loki, Chyanne and Lucky to a forest near us and they got to play with 17 strays off the leash, swim, run and didnt have a fight ever. I am really an Alfa for both the dogs that I know and that I dont, if I sense some kind o problem, just raising my voice puts and end to any kind of problem that may occur since Sometimes new strays come or just pass by from that area. Anyway, an american akita is the breed that I am thinking of right now, but is there any problem of barking or howling ? Since we live in an apartment that has a garden of 80 metre square, Loki & Chyanne and Lucky had their room there that is connected to our house but they dont get in the house just sleep and rest there. So barking too much is a problem for us, what say you about Akita's bark habbits ?\n\nIf we decide to get an Ameican Akita, does her energy level match with Loki ? Loki is now way to 10 year old, we walk about 6-7 kms a day but this will be less in a few years, like 2-3 kms maybe. Is this a short walk for an akita ? When she is 2-3 years old she have to coop with 2-3 kms with Loki also ? I wanted an owners opinion for that so I wanted to ask you all. \n\nAnother question is, off the leash walks & runs in the forest; is it a dream for us with an akita, or any of you doing this ?\nI know that they are little bit head stong breed, but a dogo argentino is head strong also, and he do just fine with walks and playing with other dogs. What is your opinion about akita ? \n\nThank you for your time and answers already.", 
    "If you get a puppy it will not be advisable to walk it for 4/7 kms until it is older.\nTemperaments vary depending on breeding and environment but they are by nature a dominant breed with high prey drive and known for being aggressive to strange dogs.\nThere is always the exception to the rule but not many owners allow their Akitas to run free they are generally known to have unreliable recall and because they are very independent dogs, even when well trained with their strong hunting instincts and dominance toward other dogs, letting them off lead can easily lead to disaster.\nBarking habits vary, mine were not really barkers but again it depends on the individual dog.\n\nThe alpha theory has been debunked", 
    "hey GsdSlave, thanks for your reply  First of all I sure will not walk with her all that kms since her joints and bones and muscle build will still be \"a work in progress\" untill she is old enough. As for off the leash and barking questions I still be waiting for akita owners answers since I think they will have their answers related to the experiences on their dogs.

Loki is 46 kgs and Chyanne was 40 kg. The flexis that we use had no problem even we use them under rainy, sunny all conditions via whole year.

I've found this community helpful and I am sure you will too.Click to expand...\n\nWhat great advise Jess, our Akita is 9 months old and has all the traits you mention. As soon as we got him we socialised him everyday, but, even with that, some people he is happy to be touched be, but, he barks at certain people and even growls at others and there is really no reason for this\nSadly, with that it makes us wary whilst out and tend to keep ourselves to ourselves as I don\u2019t like to risk him being naughty\nThe same with dogs, as he is a puppy he wants to play, but, his play is a bit more boisterous that\u2019s some and he really doesn\u2019t like other male dogs, so again, we give other dogs a wide birth\nHe changes personality as soon as we step out of the house, on red alert/guard\nI would say they are his worst parts\nHe is so good in every other way and for a 9 month old I think he is brilliant", 
    "Hey Philippa!\nI'm so happy to hear you're doing so well with your boy, he's so stinkin cute! I've followed your journey through your posts and Yoji sounds absolutely lovely.\nYou also brought up an excellent point about socialization, that really is so important with a dominant/aggressive breed. While it isn't always possible if it's an older dog, it sounds like the OP is in your shoes and definitely could benefit from careful contact with all sorts of people and, when appropriate, dogs.\nI also forgot to mention that Akitas are known for being \"aloof\". What that means is really subjective though. My male loved people but strangers were fine for about five minutes, then he lost interest. My female didn't want them to touch her and just watched them until she determined everything was \"safe\" again. Any puppy will disrupt your life, OP. We stopped having more than 3-4 people over because our girl couldn't deal. We managed her constantly. I'm not trying to discourage you at all, Sakura was one of the best things to ever happen to me. It's a reward with a lot of responsibility. Worth it, but there may be some minor sacrifices. You just need to figure out what you're willing to do. And like Philippa said, socialize!!! Lol, sorry I'm a big fan of puppies experiencing as much as they can. It helps some down the road.", 
    "Hi all\nI was attacked by my Akita a few months ago and am undergoing therapy and medical treatment, most of which has been successful. It wasn't her fault or mine, just a very sad accident. I've already posted about that but had a thought maybe you all could help me. Apologies for continuing to lean on you.\nI've been trying to find a support group online or just some good resources for people who have been attacked by dogs. The issue I keep running into is most of these groups or sites are very anti breed or anti dog and I do not want that. I am not frightened of dogs and I absolutely do not want to join an anti-Akita group. I still love my girl and I don't blame either of us. I think I just would like to hear or speak with people who have been through similar situations.\nDoes anyone know of good sites or forums for this? Everything I search is anti(insert breed here) or just so negative. I'm not looking for that, I'd like to find a supportive site or groups that understands it's a complex situation.\nThanks for any help here! My therapist suggested I look to the community so I am but apologies again for being such a downer.\nRegards,\nJess",

    "Hi guys so I need help asap!\nSo we have an female akita, 20 months old who we are sadly having to rehome.\nArya is a wonderful amazing dog and despite our best efforts to defuse her anxiety and make her feel totally included in the process she is not adapting to life with our 5 month old son. She totally ignored him with we were trying to work with, but this have now developed into a few clear warnings from the dog and a attempted warning bite to the face, at this time the baby was sitting on his dad's knee and moved his arm up into the air, which the dog clearly took as a threat!\nSo an online ad went up online for her, and a guy got in contact. They said they are prepared for multiple visits ECT but they want to meet tomorrow! My dog is very unpredictable with strangers and I have no idea how to go about making this introduction successful!\nI really want the first visit to go as well as possible so any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.\nThank You!", 
    "I am sorry that you are having to re-home your Akita. I know you have struggled with her nervousness in traffic. As you love her, have you tried consulting a behaviourist to get advice on managing her behaviour?\n\nI find that dogs accept new people more readily if they are not forced straight into eye contact with strangers. Does your Akita like treats? If so, make sure that you pass a pocketful to the prospective adopter before he meets the dog. Sit and chat about her, but without staring at Arya, and let the stranger casually pass her an occasional treat - hopefully she will begin to approach him.\nAlternatively, you could take her for a quiet walk with this person, and see how she, (and the prospective new owner), interact. Remember that he is on trial too!\nYou can not change her character overnight - or you would have already done so - but it is also not fair to pretend that your dog does not have these behavioural problems. Be honest or your dog could end up being passed on again.\n\nI hope all goes well, but if not, you could consider rehoming your dog through a breed club rescue service. The Akita Rescue and Welfare Trust (UK), known as the ARW, is a national service which exists for this purpose. Read about them online.",

    "Hi everyone\n\nI've posted here a few times before and have always received good advice. While my current situation is not one anyone can tell me how to respond to, I was hoping for some feedback during a difficult time.\n\nMy husband and I adopted an Akita, Sakura, in October 2015. She has anxiety and is reactive to other dogs and nervous around strangers. It takes her a very long time to warm up to people if she even does. She is not good around children. We have taken several classes with her and are working to find a behaviorist (we saw one several times but she had no experience with Akitas and normal breed traits, like indifference to strangers, she thought disturbing so we are looking for a new one). We have not begun medication but our vet strongly suggested it and we were looking into it when she bit me. Basically, we were doing what we could to manage and hopefully help her with her anxiety. We were enrolled in another class that started this week.\n\nA little more than 2 weeks ago, I came downstairs late to get water around 11 PM. Sakura was laying down in the hallway. I do not remember the event but a security camera picked up audio. I asked her if she wanted to come to bed and then there is just several seconds of her barking. She stopped the attack before my husband got there, no one fought or pulled her off. What is likely, based on my past behavior, is that I crouched down while reaching a hand out for her to sniff not realizing she was asleep and I frightened her. We had learned she startled easily if woken and I would not have gone near if I had realized she was sleeping. I needed to go to the emergency room and had surgery a day later, needing over 200 stitches to my face. They were layered with dissolvable ones so not 200 external stitches.\n\nI live in the US and the rescue we adopted her from took her 3 days after for a mandatory quarantine. After speaking with the rescue, they agree with my assessment that I unintentionally frightened her. They are willing to give her back to us and our county regulations would most likely not protest given the fact that it was me, not a stranger, and it was \"provoked\". I miss her so terribly as does my husband. She was so protective of me it is hard to believe this happened. I guess, given the fact that we are planning to have  children in the near-ish future, what would you do if you were me? Or anyone's thoughts or experiences? It would be impossible to feel comfortable having her around children at all given that, while all dogs are capable of biting, she has. I just look at her as my family and this is an extremely upsetting situation for us and her. I feel like I failed her.\n\nSorry for the length of this post. I appreciate anyone's feedback or advice.", 
    "Sorry but if I startled any of my dogs I would not expect to end up with 200 stitches.\n\nI can\u2019t advise you what to do, but if you are really worried It would be impossible to feel comfortable having her around children at all given that, while all dogs are capable of biting, she has.\nThen I think you have to decide if you are prepared to constantly manage and supervise her around children.\nYou have not failed her as you\u2019ve done your best in the two years you have had her, if she hasn\u2019t improved, again it\u2019s a case of if you are prepared to accept she might not improve and if you are prepared to accept her for what she is and learn to live with it.\n\nSometimes some dogs just can\u2019t be fixed, especially if it mostly genetic and one also has to think about the dog and their quality of life.", 
    "I agree with @GsdSlave.  I think it would be too risky to have children, babies or older, and to keep your dog.  Either you want children or you want to spend the rest of your life on edge and watching both dog and children - and keeping the dog shut away from your future family.\n\n200 stitches in your face, whether dissolvable ones or  not 200 external stitches is NOT something I would put up with.  OK so none of my dogs has ever really bitten and the only stitches in my face, or anywhere else, were necessitated by falling over a seizing dog while wearing spectacles and smashing my face on a stone floor, and I was within a fraction of losing my eye.\n\nBut that was not caused by a dog bite.  \n\nHowever,  I do not understand how a sleeping dog would not be aware of you approaching it, nor you be aware that the dog was sleeping so deeply that it was not aware of your presence.  Did you not talk to the dog as you approached it?  Just to make sure that it was aware of your presence?  \n\nMy opinion, for what it is worth, is that you have to make a choice between the dog and/or a possible human family.  And much as I have always loved my dogs, I know which I would choose firs.\n\nSorry if you do not like what I have said, but just looking at the scars on my face in the mirror, which were NOT caused by a dog bite, there is no way I would keep a dog that necessitated 200 facial sutures.", 
    "I am so sorry that you have had to go through this. You have an awful decision to make, and I don't know whether my own experience will be useful to you.\nIn the 1980's I had an otherwise sweet natured dog who began to have bouts of unpredictable aggression, which were solely directed at his father. When he was normal, they were fine together and they would even share a crate at shows, but his rage attacks at home were sudden and completely unprovoked. I tried rehoming him, but he would not settle, I loved him dearly, so I took him back.\nBefore long, there was a major incident in the early hours of the morning, and I was bitten on the legs and hands whilst trying to defend the older dog. My trousers were in shreds, and I was really shaken by his total loss of control. My vet had half suspected that there could be a neurological problem, and had said that if there was no improvement, we could book a brain scan at the University, so I took him in the following morning, asking for an emergency appointment. The vet refused. He said that the dog had now become too dangerous, and he talked me into having him put to sleep. He was only 14 months old, and we were both so sad about it, that he didn't even charge me. \nOn balance, I do think we came to the right decision, but this is the first time I have ever put this into words, and it still hurts, I still feel I failed him.", 
    "Thank you for the perspectives, I appreciate you all taking your time. GsdSlave, I think the children piece is the most important here. You are correct, we would have to constantly manage her around them and while we might be prepared for that, a mistake could be disastrous. People aren't perfect and I think I am frightened we would slip up.\n\nMalka, as I said it was late (for me) and I don't recall specifics. She should have heard me as our stairs are creaky and loud and she was near them. The audio has me speaking to her and from my past behavior, I know I would not have approached if I thought she was sleeping. We always talked to her when walking up to her, even if she was standing, just so she'd know we were coming and not a stranger. The rescue and our vet are both wondering if she had just come out of a seizure. Since we have never seen her have one, I would have been unaware of her epilepsy and taken her open eyes for being awake. The rescue is observing her for epilepsy and are ruling out other medical reasons.\n\nCaroleC, I am sorry for what happened to you. While I know that was painful to share, I truly appreciate it.", 
    "Jess - whether it was a seizure reaction I do not know.  But what I do know, having had a seizure dog [my Pereg in my avatar], coming out of a seizure as she did, should not have made her reactive as she did.\n\nAnd unless you are close to your dog, 24/7 as I was, you do not know whether she had had a seizure or not.  But even if she had, her reaction was not normal for coming out of a seizure.  It just does not sound as if it was seizure behaviour.\n\nI know what I think I would do under the circumstance, whether you want a human family or not.  \n\nI just have to look in the mirror, and my eye scars are not due to Pereg biting me.  I just fell over her while trying to move her head from banging on whatever it was, and fell over her and smashed my face.  And my spectacles cut into and tore the side of my eye.\n\nAs I say, I do not really have any advice for you.  Just weigh up whether you want a family and peace of mind with your girl and which is most important for your furkid and your possible future family.\n\nGood luck with whatever you decide, and please understand that whatever you do decide will no doubt be supported by us.\n\nTake care.",

It feels like an impossible scenario and I appreciate hearing people's points of view.", 
    "Jess, I do not know know anything about the breed, all I do know, and I am fairly certain that your girl's reaction  has no connection to any reaction caused by coming out of a seizure.   It just does not happen.\n\nNo, much as I hate to say this, a dog, whether disturbed from sleep or not, that causes so much damage to your face, is not a dog I would want in my home.  I have never had a dog who reacts that way if woken suddenly - all the dogs I have ever owned woke up when they hear me go near them.\n\nEven Pereg would not hit out at me when I disturbed her coming out of a major Grand Mal seizure.  Confused yes, but have a go at me?  Never.\n\nMuch as you obviously love your girl, I know what I would do.  And it would not be passing your dog onto another home in the hope that magic happens.\n\nMy opinion only.  I am sorry but as I say, that is my opinion.",

    "We had a male Akita that we got from a breeder and right from the get go we'd pick him up as a puppy and he'd growl. He wasn't bad until about a year old. A lady hugged him and after that he was aggressive towards people. My older siblings were afraid to come to the house without my dad around and once when everyone was here my mom had put the dog out telling me not to let him in she didn't trust him around the older kids who didn't live with us. But when my dad came home he let him in. My sister was petting him and he was fine one second. The next he's jumped on her and biting her arm. She was ok and didn't even need stitches. After I yelled at him he got right off but still he'd bitten. We talked to the breeder and she said once theyve bitten there isn't much you could do about it. We had to put him down. So seeing that she did that much damage it really doesn't look good. Akitas in my opinion don't do good being rehomed. I could wake my female Akita up Whenever I wanted and she might jump but she never acted aggressive like that even startled. And I agree with everyone else. No kids absolutely.", 
    "Late response, thank you all for the input. It's been tough to coordinate with the rescue, they are all volunteers and have done a great job given their time constraints. Seems like the consensus is she won't come home to us. We don't know if that means she'll be kept by them or euthanized. We agreed to abide by the rescues recommendation, no matter how difficult. We're still waiting on that but it seems pretty obvious we need to start saying our good bye. It's been a rough few weeks and I greatly appreciate the responses. It's made this journey less lonely. \nFor now, I think I say good bye. I'll need a little more time to heal and I cannot express how lucky I am to have found this community. Thank you all.\nBest,\nJess",

I, for one, hope that you will find a gentle dog/puppy so you will be able to complete your family without the fear that a new [human] baby would be at risk.",

    "I'm so sorry to read this Jess. Personally, I think a kind, gentle death is preferable to a life sentence in a no kill shelter without any hope of a real home. I hope you are healing well. Please don't beat yourself up, we can only try our best for these damaged souls. \nHope to hear some happier news in due course.",

    "jessa620 said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHi everyone\n\nI've posted here a few times before and have always received good advice. While my current situation is not one anyone can tell me how to respond to, I was hoping for some feedback during a difficult time.\n\nMy husband and I adopted an Akita, Sakura, in October 2015. She has anxiety and is reactive to other dogs and nervous around strangers. It takes her a very long time to warm up to people if she even does. She is not good around children. We have taken several classes with her and are working to find a behaviorist (we saw one several times but she had no experience with Akitas and normal breed traits, like indifference to strangers, she thought disturbing so we are looking for a new one). We have not begun medication but our vet strongly suggested it and we were looking into it when she bit me. Basically, we were doing what we could to manage and hopefully help her with her anxiety. We were enrolled in another class that started this week.\n\nA little more than 2 weeks ago, I came downstairs late to get water around 11 PM. Sakura was laying down in the hallway. I do not remember the event but a security camera picked up audio. I asked her if she wanted to come to bed and then there is just several seconds of her barking. She stopped the attack before my husband got there, no one fought or pulled her off. What is likely, based on my past behavior, is that I crouched down while reaching a hand out for her to sniff not realizing she was asleep and I frightened her. We had learned she startled easily if woken and I would not have gone near if I had realized she was sleeping. I needed to go to the emergency room and had surgery a day later, needing over 200 stitches to my face. They were layered with dissolvable ones so not 200 external stitches.\n\nI live in the US and the rescue we adopted her from took her 3 days after for a mandatory quarantine. After speaking with the rescue, they agree with my assessment that I unintentionally frightened her. They are willing to give her back to us and our county regulations would most likely not protest given the fact that it was me, not a stranger, and it was \"provoked\". I miss her so terribly as does my husband. She was so protective of me it is hard to believe this happened. I guess, given the fact that we are planning to have  children in the near-ish future, what would you do if you were me? Or anyone's thoughts or experiences? It would be impossible to feel comfortable having her around children at all given that, while all dogs are capable of biting, she has. I just look at her as my family and this is an extremely upsetting situation for us and her. I feel like I failed her.\n\nSorry for the length of this post. I appreciate anyone's feedback or advice.Click to expand...\n\nIt's important to note that after a dog bites someone it's very difficult to get insurance. Obviously the children would be in serious danger and imo, it's just one of those difficult moments when it's probably best for the dog to either be adopted by someone with a great deal of experience with Akita's and this type of issue or put her down before she hurts someone more seriously perhaps a child. I feel for you though.",

Since they have become popular yes a lot of them are poorly bred. When I first had my AA\u2019s in the 80/90s, they were of the leaner type and did a lot of winning, over the years though lovely looking\u2019 things have progressed since then but I feel they are becoming too square, too short legged, too heavy and heads getting bigger and bigger.",

    "I am fascinted by Afghan Hounds!\n\r\nMany years ago, when I was looking for a rescue dog, a lovely chap who had many years' experience with this breed asked me if I'd considered one. I asked immediately about the grooming and he admitted it was time-consuming, but assured me I should not be put off.\n\r\nI decided it was not the right choice at the time, but I did do a lot of reading up on the histroy of the breed and purely out of curiosity (I don't have the right home for one right now - I know that already) I have started reading a bit of what's available on the internet in temrs of information.\n\r\nMy main question is, current advice seems to be that the coat needs snoods, coats, socks, onesies - just to enable the hound to go outside or eat!\n\r\nSo, back in the day, when they were kept as working dogs in Afhanistan, Pakistan, Iran etc., who did all this grooming? I'm guessing they had much less coat, or at least coat of a different texture, (like my teflon spaniel) or were routinely clipped somehow?\n\r\nIs the profusion of coat purely an invention / evolution for the show ring?\n\r\nI've read older accounts of Afghans being more of a multi-purpose animal than just a flat out fast-moving sight-hound. One account talked about the hounds patrolling the palace at night and being quite effective guards. \n\r\nHow can a breed get so far removed from its origins...............or has it?!\n\r\nI'm just genuinely curious", 
    "Hello,\n\nI am glad you brought up the point as it is something I have wondered about too. I guess it's one of those cases where they just know how to take care of them selves when they are in their natural habitat. I mean when they were kept as working dogs in their native lands, they had to take care of themselves and they are pretty good at it.\nI have never come across anything that said that the Afghans had shorter coats back in those days. Also, they must have had different grooming requirements due to the different climatic conditions of the Middle East. And after all, isn't it quite normal that the affectionate owners would do anything in their power to make their dogs look more graceful and be as comfortable as possible? I mean, they are not working dogs anymore, but gorgeous, exotic pets that deserves every care they can get.",

My female Afghan Hound, usually shy of newly met men, went straight up to him and looked in his eyes, not afraid at all.\n I have owned the breed for 24 years now and like most people admire a nicely groomed hound, but I wish they weren't as heavily coated.\nIt is a pain for a dog to be every other day on the grooming table, especially when older.\n Also, when meeting people first question is \"how long and often they need to be groomed\".\n I think is a disservice to the breed functionally too. Just imagine the state of a hound's coat after a day's running free into the bush, or the life of one kept away from running freely in the nature.\n If it had less hair, the Afghan Hound would have less admirers but more people would own them. They'd be much happier during summer. My female is breathing heavy from a walk in hot weather while the male I keep short haired is suffering less.", 
    "My mother was a longtime fancier, exhibitor and breeder of Afghan Hounds. I have inherited a large collection of Afghan Hound Review magazines dating from the 1970s thru 1990s (most if not all issues) and several issues of Afghan Hound Gazette as well. I am hoping to sell these (as I am the estate representative) but have no idea what to ask for this collection or how to advertise it. I am located in middle TN and think mailing these would cost way too much. Is there anyone nearby interested in making me an offer on these and coming to get them? I hate to just throw them away as I'm sure someone would enjoy and value this collection my mother saved for so many years. \n\npaula.l.knox@gmail.com",

    "That is a good suggestion Malka. \nIn the UK we also have second hand book dealers who specialise in dog ephemera. Not sure about the US, but here they usually have stands at major championship shows - do you know any exhibitors you could ask for a contact number? \nOr there is always eBay!", 
    "Hi everyone, hope you all doing well. I have rescued a white Afghan Hound froma far away village of Afghanistan. Its hairs have already fallen, skin in quite infected, having multiple types of incests in skin. He is totally not ready for a bath. What should I do, please teach me step by step. I am looking to take care of him for a couple of days here and then shift to Kabul. What should I do to cool him down, have a bath, spray and get-in in my room. I am hurry to see him beside me. Plz help.", 
    "Can you post a photo so we can give you correct advice", 
    "Poor dog. I really don't know how to help as I don't know what services you have available. Ideally, the Dog needs to see a vet, is there one in the area? If not, you need an experienced person to tell you what the infestation is. The most common ones are fleas, lice, and the mange mite, some are easier to treat than others. Perhaps a dog shelter, a farmer, a police dog handler or a pharmacy could give you an opinion. Is there still a zoo in Kabul? If so, they might be able to help. We will look at photo's, but it will not be as good as seeing the actual skin of the dog would be.\nYou will need the correct treatment if it is going to work - I'm afraid that I don't know what is available in Afghanistan, but a pharmacist will know. If all else fails, Google some pictures of the pests I have named, see if you can identify them, and look up any remedies that are available to you.\nGood luck David, I hope you can make him better.",

    "Hello everyone,\n\nI am new and have a question for you all .\n\nCan anyone give me an insight to this pups breed/cross? He is supposed to be a belgian Shepard X labrador, he's 4 months old and I'm considering taking him on as current owners find themselves unable to keep him. I was originally after a lab was pointed towards this guy.\n\nI have experience with labs but not belgian shepards and certainly not a cross of the two.\n\nApart from being cute what do we think? Would he stay long haired as coat appears to change around his face. Just being nosey really.\n\nhttps://image.ibb.co/gTab5c/58.jpg\n\nhttps://image.ibb.co/fnzNBH/58_1.jpg\n\nI haven't uploaded pic to a forum for a while but the links should work as photobucket wasn't!", 
    "You are posting on the Groenendael forum but I find it hard to believe that this puppy could be a Lab X Groenendael. In my opinion the coat is too fluffy and he has too much white to have come from two solid coloured breeds. My guess would be Lab x Collie, but maybe one of those parents could have been crossed crossed with a BSD. \nHe is a good looking puppy though, and this is a smart looking, and very trainable, cross.", 
    "I cannnot see any Groenendael in this puppy but he is definitely a good looking puppy, and as @CaroleC  says, a very trainable cross.\n\nRegarding Photobucket, it is no longer a free photo site so unless you are prepared to pay rather a lot every month, you not only cannot use it but have probably lost anything stored on it.", 
    "Hi there,\n\nMy dog Luc, whom I've had for 10 years, turns 14 next month.  \n\nWe reconnected with his foster parents, and they came by to visit him yesterday.  I was under the impression Luc is a German Shepherd/Border Collie mix, but his foster dad told me that he remembered Luc was a Belgian Shepherd.\n\nI've contacted the rescue to see if they have records.\n\nLuc is all black, except for a white spot on his chest and on the tip of his penis.  He does not have a long coat however, so if he is Belgian, he must be a mix as I'm pretty sure there are no short-coated Groenendaels.\n\nHe was 68lbs when I adopted him - was to the vet yesterday and weighed 49.4lbs, he naturally slimmed up over a matter of time.\n\nSome pics may help - I'm wondering if experienced people can weigh in on whether his mix is likelier to include GSD or Groenendael.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope that's enough pictures to get an idea.  I'm sure he's a GSD mix, but I got curious.",

We took him home and it took him a little while to get used to people, especially males, he used to be scared of my husband for months and months. With a time he started feeling better about people and actually started liking a company. We believe he was abused badly with the previous owners, he was so skinny, had anxiety issues and was afraid of everything.\nAs a time passed by he got over a lot of things, he is a different dog now, a happy dog,\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n it took him about 6 month to start barking and being protective over his territory. But oh man, how smart he is! I taught him so many tricks in no time, he just gets everything...\nPound and vet told us that Belgian Shepherd is his prime breed. But I was just wondering who he could be mixed with... I would think with German because he is really smart, but where is he getting those absolutely adorable fluffy ears??

I haven't found an answer - we have a local skatepark, but it is too scary for him, and he just panics. It is hard to set up a controlled exposure programme as we don't have many kids round here.

Nowadays, due to different use, there is a huge difference between the 3 beauties and the beast (The ones with the long and rough coat and the shorthaired Malinois) The Mal has been considdered the ugly one and combined with the fact that working people prefer to train thier dogs than to groom them made that the emphasis for breeding has been different between the \"beauties\" (Groenendael, Tervuren en Laekenois) and the \"beast\"(Malinois). The beauties have been bred formost for thier looks and the Malinois for his capability to work in Belgian Ring. This difference in breeding goals has had its impact on build and character off the different breeds. the beauties are more homogene if you consider thier exterior but they have a softer character. On the other hand the true Malinois is not so homogene as his counterparts with other coats but has a much harder character and is more dominant then the other 3 versions.\n\r\nGreetings\n\n\r\nJohan",

The Groenendael's by contrast seem to be a much more confident dog and I quite like those although they still have too much coat for me, never seen a Laekenois over here so can't comment on their personality. I have to say that the Mal is certainly not the \"beast\" in my eyes, I actually prefer them. The ones I have seen are mostly show bred but there are a couple in agility that are working bred and they are completely different, harder, more attitude and loads more drive, almost like a different breed. if I had a belgian it would be a mal and it would have to be a working bred one, definitely not a beast!",

I'm no show boffin (find it all hard to follow   ) but believe that's right.\n\r\nBelgians need ongoing socialisation - yes they can be \"shy\" and \"wimpy\" but IMO this can be due to incorrect socialisation as much as anything. \n\r\nMy own Belgian is not shy nor wimpy but was thoroughly socialised and worked with from a very young age  \n\r\nThey are quite different to collies - I've known a few collie  people who have had them and who have gone back to their original breed as the Belgian \"but I do need a reason\" and their distractedness etc can be hard to understand for someone used to the collie intensity.

The other is my 16 month youngster and if he is asked to do something a second time he looks surprised, a third time and he often refuses as he can't see why when he has already done it. \n\r\nI like this attitude in a dog, I like dogs that can think for themselves and mine are brought up to be independant and do just that, maybe not perfect for an agility dog but that's the way I like them. A lot of collie owners seem to be turning to kelpies at the moment as an alternative to a collie, if they go into it with their eyes open they will be fine but most that I have spoken to know nothing about the breed and think they are just like a collie.........", 
    "Belgian shepherds have of course different lines, working and showing, but there is a big variance also inside the lines, even inside a litter. The more they are spread as a breed, the more they are bred to be suitable to every family and every owner. \n\r\nWhen I went to tervs almost 20 years ago, I met dogs, who didn't want to have contact to strangers, still not scared, only reluctant to be touched by someone they didn't know. After that they are bred more open and social, but also at the same time some sort of stubborness in work has gone. I prefer the old type behaviour, they can be touched freely, if owner allows it. But never so, that dog is scared or nervous. \n\r\nI have to admit, that all the talk about \"wimpy\" BSDs has not come out of the blue, we should take more consideration in temperaments, but most of our dogs are really nice and hardworking, if given chance. In Scandinavia we are very lucky to have our special scandinavian events, tracking, search, signal and special event (kind of a triathlon for dogs) to maintain the working qualities. \n\r\nBut true openness I really value in workinglines. They have strong drives and any unsociality takes away part of the trust in the dog and it's work. Socially strong dog is so much more easier to handle and train. I am not too interested in bitework myself anymore, I am more into scandinavian tracking and FH, but under the circumstances I see a lot of bitework and training from KNPV to IPO. It is always a pleasure to work with open and strongminded dog. For showlines real bitework is not always possible, some qualities are missing. Of course lower levels are possible, but for real competition, I don't think so. In old lines some dogs still work, but I never sell showline for protection work.\n\r\nAlltogether BSD is a nice breed with lots of possibilities, if you just choose a line that goes with your needs and activities. \n\r\nAt least I would never change!  \n\r\nJ",

This combined with black gives a pale beige/cream (known as Champagne in mice & rats, Lutino in rabbits and Beige in cavies). But because of the different eye structure of dogs compared to rodents & rabbits, the eyes appear blue not pink (just as the eyes of a Siamese cat appear blue but the equivalent gene in other animals gives a pink or red eye).\n\nThis Terv does look very washed out but the main feature is that he is lacking a mask. The gene that gives black masking in Belgians is E(m). It is a dominant gene meaning a dog only has to have one E(m) gene to have a mask. \n\nAs he is bred from Groenendaels, there is no way of knowing if a Groeny is E(m) E(m) or E(m)E = having only one gene for black masking. IF by sheer chance you bred two Groenies together that each had only one E(m) gene, some of the litter will be born without masks. But of course if the entire dog is black, you wouldn't see it! But you would on a Terv.... ;-) \n\nWith regard to the pale colour, another possibility is he is a Blue Tervueren (still without a mask). However the dark pigment he has on ears, tail etc. would be blue, not black and I would expect the eyes to be unusually light as well (as is the case with all blue dilute dogs).\n\nThe lack of red in his coat may logically be another side-effect of coming from Groenendaels. As you would know, Bijou, you can't selectively breed for a nice deep red when your dogs are black! \n\nThe fact that he has come from two Groenendael parents means both parents carry a gene for non-black. Groenies are normally KK [sometimes written as K(b) K(b)]. However some can be K(b)k(y), meaning they have one hidden gene for non-black. This is fairly uncommon but not rare, as Merlin's father [pedigree Groenendael] must have had the same genotype; as do Groens that have a Terv parent.",

    "Just looks like a pale Terv to me, without a mask.  He's a lovely colour.  He wouldn't be a dilute though with the black pigment on his nose and lips though would he?  My Estrela bitch is a pale fawn, which is unusual, but she's not a dilute colour, just pale.", 
    "Loki's mum said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nJust looks like a pale Terv to me, without a mask.Click to expand...\n\nYes I totally agree - it's the lack of mask that makes him stand out. He is young yet so he may develop more black overlay as he gets older, but his mask will stay the same. I stand by my earlier explanation of the lack of mask being down to the absence of E(m).\n\nWith regard to his pale colour, the light forms of Belgians (and some other breeds) have been suggested to be because of a gene which dilutes phaeomelanin (yellow) without affecting black pigment.\n\nOriginally this was thought to be possibly a relative of albino, on the C-locus (which is the series relating to albinism) but recent research has ruled this out.\n\nIt's now classed as the I for Intensity gene, possibly similar to the I for Inhibitor gene which gives a similar effect in cats (and which also was once thought to be on the C-Locus!)\n\nI have always thought this I gene was responsible for \"grey\" Tervuerens and Malinois, but was told by a breeder that the \"Greys\" are far paler than that. I still think the Greys have the I gene but perhaps other modifiers are responsible for the amount of yellow still in the coat.\n\nI am sure Bijou will correct me if I am wrong, but in Tervs and Malis (also Laekenois) in countries using the FCI breed standard, paler shades are actively discouraged, which may be why they are less common - but of course a Groen could happily carry the right genes to create the light body colour without anyone realising.... until one pops up. I'm not sure, but I think this pup is is overseas in an FCI country.\n\nVery interesting article regarding all forms on dilution by the world's most influential canine colour geneticist at present (mapping all the colours at a molecular level):\nhttp://homepage.usask.ca/~schmutz/dilutions.html#intense",

    "My husband has been researching dogs and insist that he found the perfect family dog in the Boerboels.  I was hoping someone who actually owns them can tell me if I am wrong in thinking that no, this is not the right breed for us.  We had grown children, one to get married soon and no grandkids yet.  We have 2 female dogs, a 5 year old medium mixed golden and 15 lb 6 year old Border Terrier who does not like other dogs and becomes upset and will fight any dog in her path.  My husband said our border terrier, Lucy will be fine with a puppy.  For this reason I feel we should wait until she is gone.   She is fine with our golden, Moxie, but they were raised together.  So here is my question.  Are these dogs good with other dogs?  We have owned other breeds, a boxer, swissy, and rescued an american bulldog that we had for a year.  I have to wonder if we did get this breed of dog without having children around how would it take to one in the future when it is older and grown?  I really don't want a dog I have to worry about when friends come over, the UPS guy, meter reader, or pest control man.  Our boxer went after a few of these so I don't want to go through that again. I also read they are banned in over 11 countries.  I would love some feedback as he is mad at me for not considering this breed.",

    "I personally wouldn't get a dog to guard my house, but I am glad that you are doing your research. I am no expert but growing up in south africa, I knew a number of boerboels and they were all great dogs, but as has been said before, they do require a lot of extra training. My brother and his partner took one on and put a lot of time and effort into her and it just wasn't enough. She's now with my parents who are retired and able to spend a lot more time and training with her - it has paid off though. \n\n\n\n\nDooley said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nthese type of breeds don`t always have the desired effectClick to expand...\n\n\r\nI am so sorry to hear of your break in Dooley.  You are right, my parents live in South Africa and have 2 Boerboels and they are wonderful dogs, big softies! My parents were burgled by 3 armed men who were caught out by a neighbour, but the dogs were asleep in the 'sun room' which is like a conservatory really.  They too had run of the house.  And they didn't bother!! They didn't bother either when the armed security company turned up!   \n\r\n'yappy' dogs do have a better effect.\n\r\nGood luck with it all.", 
    "Like has been said by many already you really do need to think long and hard before deciding on getting one - unfortunately many don't so the dogs end up in rescue.\n\r\nSome things to consider:\n\n\nMany insurance companies have added these breeds to their exclusion list - can you afford vet bills without insurance? They are large breeds so costs are usually much higher. For example, my dog (a Presa) has had a steel plate put in his knee (cost over \u00a32,000) and is epileptic so requires a larger dose of meds (than say a smaller dog) \u00a330 a month - and also has check ups every 7 months.\n\nOther dogs - while you may do everything in your power to make your dog well socialised, what happens if some idiots dog attacks yours and your dog responds? Unfortunately people will be quick to blame your 'big bad dog' even if it wasn't his fault. And I can tell you there are a LOT of idiot dog owners who walk their dogs on the streets and in parks. So if you don't have a private area to walk your dog it's something to bear in mind.\n\nThese dogs are dominant breeds - they need constant training (and I don't mean 'firm') you need to make sure they know their boundaries (via training). If you don't they will take the lead - which is never a good thing for a dog.\n\nStrength - they are VERY strong. Imagine walking past another dog on a narrow path and they decide they don't like each other!\n\nPhysical and mental stimulation - same with most dogs really, but on top of the usual, they love to chew things - so make sure they don't get hold of anything toxic.\n\n\r\nAside from that, and while I can't talk for other breeds, Rocky is quite territorial - so yes, he is a fantastic watch dog. Any noise and he will want to investigate. He will also not tolerate strangers in the house unless he knows you (as their owner) are ok with them.\n\r\nMy biggest gripe is other dogs and breed prejudice - I've always worried he'd get into a fight even though he is very well socialised and loves other dogs, if anything did happen - people would be quick to point the finger of blame on him, even though he wouldn't be to blame.",

    "I am very familiar with the boerboel breed. I don't see anything about him that indicates he is a mix.

    "i do scent work with my foxhounds we hunt the clean boot the earlier you start the better, we use a harness to show the hound she is going to do a job then with baby lines we have people the hound knows drop a scent item in sight of the hound and let the hound see them go them after a few min he ask the hound to go find, then you would just increase the distance over time and time, however once the hound understand the game we dont let the hound see the person go off, if the hound is unsure of going itto the person we use their name and treats to gain their trust in the sport, she will love it as mine do and the bloodhounds,all this is done on line so u can help hound out and keep under control, also start on virgin land(land thats not that often walked acrossed so scent is undestubed", 
    "Top Tip when training a Search Square.\n\r\nStart with small square say ten paces each side.\n\r\nPut in pole at each corner.\n\r\nWalk round twice (this marks the area to be searched)\n\r\nPlace a small piece of food at each pole\n\r\nPut dog on line when starting\n\r\nThis is to get the dog conditioned to stay in square and make the poles mean something.\n\r\nOnce the dog gets the hang of going out to each pole to look for food.\n\r\nYou can then replace the food with toys \n\r\nNote NEVER put out toys and food at the same time.\n\r\nHowever.................\n\r\nAll of the above is pointless if the dog has not learned to retrieve............\n\r\nFor some dogs an intermediate step of puting food INTO an article can be helpful (so they bring out container to  you) but for others it can be detrimental.\n\r\nPlease note toys should be PLACED first of all so the dog, particularly your breed, learns that toys are associated with yoru footsteps, ie the dog will TRACK your foot steps across the square.\n\r\nLater on when you tramp all over the square you can THROW objects in.\n\r\nFill the square with toys at first so the dog is always successful and do not make the dog work too long ie you can stop the game at any time, the dog does not have to find EVERYTHING. \n\r\nAlso mix up the SIZE of articles, always set up the do to succeed.\n\r\nYou can then make the square larger and large and when the dog knows the game, dispense with poles and squares altogether, just walk around and throw them in.\n\r\nps let the dog SEE you place/throw things at first; tie it up in sight.\n\r\nGood luck\n\r\nEventually you can place items IN the ground, UNDER cover, ON raised items like posts etc.",

    "I agree with Tupacs.  I don't know if you have decided to have another male or female?  All the male Bassets I have known don't take too kindly to other male dogs in their house.  Mr Flynn maybe different?  Harvey is 4 and would be very unhappy if I brought another male in.  He is very happy with females and Bassets have always surprised me at how welcoming from day one they are with another puppy.  Bassets love the company of other dogs and to see them play together - you know you have made the right decision.  I wouldn't worry about your relationship with Mr Flynn with another Basset in the home, male bassets always get the most cuddles and attention as they are always more attentive and needy than any other dog I know.  When I had two they both managed to squeeze themselves on my lap, until my legs went dead with the weight.  They always slept together, sniffed the same blade of grass for 10 minutes - it really is a joy to see two Bassets together, because lets be honest, other dogs just don't understand them and they really shine with another of their kind.",

    "I have a male Basset and until recently a female one, she was unfortunately put to sleep in July.  I would NEVER be without a Basset.  I absolutely adore them, they have such special characters about them.  They are not a dog you can ignore.  They really do need to be with you all the time, they follow you everywhere, from room to room and their main pleasure is to be on you wherever you are.  They are not happy unless they are sleeping on top of you or have some part of their body resting on you.  \n\r\nThey love their walks, but don't be fooled by their body, they are athletic and bred for endurance.  Mine will/would happily walk for 2 hours a day.  Because their scenting ability is only second to a bloodhound, the most interesting thing for them is every blade of grass so you are never going to go for a quick sprint round the block!  I have no problem with mine coming back, they do not run away but if they have a scent of something they do not shift, no amount of calling will help until they have finished.\n\r\nThey are the soppiest things ever and are very affectionate with their owners.  Harvey takes a dislike to some male visitors and growls at them.  Millie never liked men walking behind me when we were out and would always bark at them but with children they let them do anything to them and never have a problem with visitors who come to our house regularly.  \n\r\nI have found that they are bullet proof, no nervous issues.  They are not scared of anything or maybe I have been lucky.\n\r\nThe downside is their slobber, don't ask me how they manage it, but I put something clean on for work and as soon as I get outside I notice slobber on the bottom of my trousers or on my sleeve!.  Luckily as they are short the slobber doesn't venture too high on the walls or kitchen cupboards.\n\r\nIf you want an affectionate, greedy, fun, friendly dog but don't mind the slobber or their deafness when they don't want to do something they are definitely the dog for you.\n\r\nIf you are looking for a breeder, I can recommend Balmacara.  They have their own website and her dogs are wonderful.\n\r\nSorry it was such a long post but I love them!\n\r\nSarah", 
    "Sorry forgot to mention  .... mine do not smell.  The reason some smell is because of their ears.  Because they are so long they manage to get in everything so I wash their ears and always clean the inside of their ears with dog ear wipes once a week.  They don't smell any worse than any other dog if you keep their ears in check.  I will shut up now!\n\r\nSarah", 
    "Thankyou Sarah\r\nSlobber and stubborness are something I'm already very much used to with my DDB bitch Trinny, shes the worlds largest drool monster \r\nI will take a look at the breeders website, thanx again", 
    "A Basset would be great with your Dogue.  I have found when you mix them with a different breed it seems to up their game when on a walk.  Instead of sniffing everything, they keep up with the other dog so it makes for a more normal walk than a long stroll when you have two!  Good luck.  x", 
    "How would a Basset be with a big dopey English setter do you think, should I ever be in a position to have a third dog?

    "I love English Setters!  \n\r\nI know my two Bassets loved other dogs, big or small.  They don't mind what breed as long as they want to say hello and play on their walks.  Harvey gets on very well with my mum's Beardie and lives and loves my Golden Retriever.  They are very playful dogs and love a good game, although they can be a bit too boisterous for smaller dogs as they are heavy.  Harvey's favourite game is play fighting with my Retriever, they do it all day.   \n\r\nThey think they are big dogs anyway, so I'm sure they would get on with any larger breed.",

    "Hi\r\nWe have 2 Bassetts and it is really interesting reading other comments by other Bassett owners.  Our Bassetts have HUGE personalities!!\r\nThey do smell really bad as they are on Natural food hence quite a gassy tummy - yuck! \r\nOurs are very stubborn and definately classed as a thief as they steal anything that a human can use expecially a mobile phone, tv remote control, shoes etc.  If you put your hand into get it you will get a growl, bark then bite (I did have to go to a&e once).  I know this is resource guarding issue but I don't think their stubbornness helps this...\n\r\nI agree they are very energetic - ours love a 3 hour walk/run around!  We don't let them off the lead as they do run away.  In an enclosed area our reacall is very good though.  \n\r\nOurs love cheese, corned beef and tuna.  they have an amazing sense of smell.\n\r\nwe have seen a behaviourist (I call it family therapy!) and their behaviour is getting better (I have also spoken to another Bassett owner in a pet shop and she was buying a muzzle for her one!) so I am not sure if this stealing is a trait in some bassetts?  I guess each one is different.  Our 2 have totally different personalities from each other.  Our oldest always makes sure that you know he is there as he always does large yawns with lots of noise and then looks up at you, the little one yawns but quitely.\n\r\nSaying all that I wouldn't swap them for the world and dread the fact that they might bite someone else hence I keep a very close eye on the around strangers for their stealing and biting.  They are great with kids pulling at their ears and love nothing better than being snuggled up on the sofa or bed getting attention.  They follow me from room to room in the house and always need to be near.  It is one of the best feelings in the world knowing that no matter how bad your day has been there are 2 big, fat dogs waiting to shower me with affection! When I pull up on the drive way both of them are on the windowsill looking for me and then run to the door to greet me when I get out of the car.\n\r\nGood luck if you decide to get one.  It may just be the way that we have treated ours and they have turned out to be brats!", 
    "Hi Rachel, nice to have another Basset Hound owner on here.  Sorry to hear about the biting!  I think Harvey chewed one phone when he was a puppy but I think I must of got a couple of angels - neither one of mine have stolen anything.  It is quite funny at times, as there may be a biscuit on the coffee table and Harvey will put his nose cms away from it and just stare at it for ages, obviously willing it to slip into his mouth!  I must admit I have to give him a bit as he is so patient.  He has definitely got more greedy since he has been castrated so maybe it is only a matter of tiime before the biscuits find there own way into his mouth.", 
    "Do you get the whining when he is staring at the food on the table?!  We do from the oldest one (the younger one is better behaved!!) It is quite pathetic but very funny.  I must admit I eat the chocolate off the biscuit and give him half of the rest.... oops!  The oldest also will be lying on the sofa or our giant bean bag and just make some random noises - again they are very very funny!", 
    "I know what you mean.  Harvey talks to me all the time.  I have had or been brought up with many breeds of dogs but I can honestly say there is nothing quite like a Basset!", 
    "Is it just me......or does anyone else think that Linda Lusardi now resembles a Basset ??", 
    "That had me in stitches!",

    "This is to them of you who no about bassett.\n\r\nIn your knolege do they bark a lot? An can they be traine to sit, down and so on\n\r\nAnd one last thing i have other dogs that it will be left with when I go . I have herd they get nervus/barky when left, will it be OK with another dog for companion?\n\r\nThank you\r\njavek", 
    "They are hounds so yea they bark and there bark can be quite (how shall I put this. . .) wierd, annoying anyway you know this coz you got one.  So yea they bark hun  In regards to the sitting etc I think they are just like any other dog, but I'm no expert perhaps someone here has one and can give you advice.  Good luck", 
    "I have never owned a bassett, but I do have a friend who has two.\n\r\nThey bay/sing/howl more than a bark but with my friends dogs they normally only did so when people came to the house etc.  \n\r\nShe had two and they could be left no problem, though they were always well excercised beforehand.\n\r\nAs for trainging - well, yes, from what I've seen, you can train them to sit etc, but whether they decide to do it when you ask them is a different matter.  They are very strong willed and many people say shouldn't be let off the lead because of this - i.e. they will only come back if they want to.", 
    "Like many scent hounds Bassetts do bark/wail/howl etc etc. Dogs are dogs and can all be trained to various things with varying degrees of success, but scent hounds can be defient....often in a very commical way though! \n\r\nI owned a fox hound cross who could be very well behaved but could also become completely deaf when an interesting smell was around. He barked A LOT ! But he was a rescued dog and arrived in our home with a ten year barking habbit. \n\r\nBassetts may be more likely to bark than some other breeds but if you start as you mean to go on with a puppy and take them to training classes that use positive methods then you should be able to keep this barking to a level that you find ok.", 
    "Hi\n\r\nI have had Bassets and have one now, I can only say from experience that mine have never excessively barked.  Only when someone comes to the door.  They are not particularly territorial like some dogs so will not bark at every opportunity.  My garden backs onto 5 other properties and they never bark at people when they are in their garden or if they hear another dog.  However, they do not like to be left alone for long periods of time, in fact I have found they need human attention more than any other breed I have owned so this could be why they howl or bay if left unattended.  Mine have always had someone at home and at the most are left for 3 hours.  They definitely like the company of another dog and I wouldn't suggesting owning a Basset unless you have two.  \n\r\nHarvey will sit and wait on command, however will come when ready.  He does not run away like some Bassets and I can let him off the lead no problem as I have done with previous Bassets.  \n\r\nIf you are intending to own one, I would suggest firm handling - I don't mean being forceful but they really do need to know who is boss - especially the boys.  Mine are allowed on the sofa but only when I say they can - not every night etc., they have to have rules and you have to make sure you stick with them otherwise they will take a mile and will want to rule the roost and you get all sorts of behavourial problems later on.\n\r\nThey are extremely loving dogs and so much fun.  Harvey makes me laugh all the time.  I haven't found them particularly difficult, in fact very easy to live with and be around.  \n\r\nHope that helps.\n\r\nSarah", 
    "Hi\r\nI have 2 bassetts & they are both pretty vocal. One will always set the other off. My bitch is the oldest & is quite territorial & very vocal. The males have a tendency to 'bay' which is a cross between a bark & a hwol, which is very loud!. \r\nthey are very social dogs, that love attention & so are not good when left for longer than 4-5hrs. That said, the practicalities of todays living don't go hand-in-hand with the ethos, so I always have a quick play with mine in the garden before I leave for work & always leave a radio on, so they have noise, rather than them focusing on noises from outside, which obviously trigger a reaction.", 
    "You can train a hound to do anything, and they learn very quickly only problem being when asked to do something they will only oblige if they can see the point in obeying. \n\r\nHounds live by the \"what's in it for me\" rules. Mind you that is why most hound owners love them, for their intelligence and independence.", 
    "I agree entirely with Pita.  \n\r\nI also find it very interesting to hear about other Basset Hound owners and their dogs.  I think it just proves every dog is an individual and whilst you can research the breed and have an understanding of their traits, some just don't want to conform.  But I think that sums up Bassets - definitely their own dog!  You will never find a hound that doesn't have a character all of their own.",

    "We have homed two Bassets through Boxer Rescue, both bitches, both tri-coloured and both adorable. Charlotte, the older of the two was about 10 when she was taken out of the stray kennels and was a grand old lady, she died aged 14 and all the family was devastated by her loss.\n\r\nThe second one, also from the stray kennels, we called Betty (Basset), and was a terror!!! She would clear off down the river bank with her nose down and owner in hot pursuit, and would howl the place down and tear the place to bits when left. Two crates later it was easier to leave her with family when the owners went out!! She's about 10 years old now and STILL can't be left but her nature is second to none!", 
    "Thurber was rescued by my son when he was about 6 months old. Someone had obviously hurt him and abandoned him or he had gotten away and they just didn't care. He was found flea / tick infested, hungry and he had abit of a violent streak. Fear biting. He is past that now. It took us alittle while and some patience. He is now going on 6 years and is a good boy most of the time. Once in awhile he gets into it with our Chow , they are both abit bossy. Not often though since he loses. We try to keep them apart. He does like to sing with any music, ahha or make his own. Luckily our neighbors don't mind. He is an overall sweetie. I would like to hear more about your k-9 crew, sounds like you have quite a few too!!!", 
    "I am a proud new owner of a 5 month old Basset Hound. We got DUKE in November and we love him to death...can you tell? hehehe He is super good. Ofcourse I don't think he knows he is suppose to howl but he has the deep bark down good. Enjoy the pics!", 
    "Hello to all Basset Hound owners ... looking forward to meeting people who are mad as me about this wonderful breed.  I have two Bassets, Harvey who is 2 and Millie aged 3.  Both are absolute nutters and always make me smile.\r\nI can't post pics at the moment but when I can I will put them on here.\n\r\nSarah", 
    "OK, hope this works - pictures of Millie (unfortunately she died recently) and Harvey - my Bassets.", 
    "They're lovely - sorry to hear about Millie though.\n\r\nMy friend's bassets are different shapes from each other - one is much more stocky than the other.  I think she said that there were different types & that one was an american and the other english - does that sound right?  \n\r\nI persuaded her to enter a companion show a couple of months ago but unfortunately being typical bassets they decided that they didn't want to do what they were supposed to & both sat down and refused to move.", 
    "Millie was a lot lighter than Harvey and less wrinkled - she looked more like a beagle to me and climbed like a goat.  I miss her loads as she had the most wonderful temprement.  She loved everyone and everything and was very well behaved - definitely not a typical Basset.  \n\r\nHowever, Harvey is a Balmacara, bred for showing and is very typical of what you see at Crufts.  He is very heavy and has lots of wrinkles.  He is great fun, he loves water and often goes for a swim, he loves his walks but he does nothing quickly and if he finds a good smell no amount of calling will get him to come.  He is very good though now with the basic commands.  I remember taking him to puppy socialisation classes which were unfortunately at 7 pm which was Harvey's sleeping time.  In the end the trainer gave up on him as he wouldn't even wake up and he only came second at the end of the course as there were only 2 dogs left.  \n\r\nI love Bassets, I would love another one someday but getting another so soon after Millie died didn't feel right, so my partner decided on a Golden Retriever.  I do believe that you should have more than one Basset as they are hounds and love the company of other dogs.  I couldn't recommend them more.\n\r\nSarah",

    "They really do love all dogs.  Harvey mixes well with my mum's Bearded Collie and any other dog who will play with him.  Millie loved all dogs, large or small.  \n\r\nHarvey adores our new Golden Retriever puppy and follows her everywhere and even lets her try dragging him across the floor by his ears!  He is exceptional with her.  He never gets cross with her.\n\r\nThey are not for everyone, if you want a dog who obeys your commands instantly - forget it!  They hate to be left out of anything and will howl if left alone for a long period.  Harvey is not the fastest dog in the world but he loves his walks and will happily go out for 2 hours.  They love to get on the sofa and cuddle up in the evenings.  I just love them.",

    "Just brought home our Anatolian Shepherd last weekend and at barely 12 weeks this little guy could chew a hole through anything.  I have already gone through so many chew toys and from what I read online basically all rawhides or antlers are a big no no.  This leaves me exhausted by the end of the day.  I have already taught him how to sit and seems to know the pee pee command.  But man can he be stubborn.  He also has shown some aggression to certain chews and has growled when I attempt to take them.  I just sit by him and keep putting my hands all over his mouth and taking it and then giving it back.  It seems to be helping.  Does anyone have breed specific advice for training this guy before he gets huge?  I have 5 kids and they adore him, but I need him to be socialized and ready to be out with the family.  Any tips or helps I could use.  Good thing he is so cute.", 
    "Hi! I have never heard of that kinda breed (Im going to Google it after this! lol) but it sounds like ur doing a good job with socializing him. I have 4 kiddos & a 1yr old Alaskan malamute & shes a handful! lol. I didn't have her as a wee pup (I bought her off a girl that never worked with this dog) so it was tough in the beginning to straighten her out. Shes come quite a ways tho. She'll growl & nip at my kids (they r 8yrs & under) so I have to correct the kids & tell Mila NO for nipping them. She does have a lil food aggression but she knows better than to growl at me when im near her food dish. I tell the kids to leave her be when shes eating. So with some work Mila will get better  hopefully someone on here with more expertise can help ya out more!", 
    "We brought home an 1.5 year old Anatolian Shepherd/Australian Shepherd mix from the pound this month, and he has surprised us with his chewing! I have no experience with this breed, and it has been a lot of fun to see what Crusoe likes to get up to. My biggest hurtle (along with digging) has been his occasional roughness with our three children. He responds well to a spray bottle of water in that situation (I hide it behind my back), and I keep him on a leash for those training sessions. Have you heard of the book Think Like Your Dog and Enjoy the Rewards, by Diana Young? It's been very helpful for me.", 
    "I don't think you have much to worry about, I haven't met a pup yet that wasn't a little on the \"bitey\" side. Just remember to YELP! very very loud when you are playing with him and he bites a little too hard, the YELP! has to scare even him, so don't do a little cutesy yelp just because he's a pup. You'll want to be so loud that it makes him recoil right away with ears back, so you can connect the sound with his biting to hard.\n\nPutting your hands in his mouth and taking a chew toy or bone away and giving him it straight back is the right thing to do imo. \n\nMy wife and I would do that for all our dogs, sometimes its good to have a hidden treat in your hand, then reach into his food bowl \"while he is eating\", just drop the treat in there. This way the act could mean a potential bonus for him, so he won't be so quick to protect his food when someone reaches into his bowl. Also make all the kids do this too, if its just you then it's only going to be you he will do it for. I made my son do this with my Huskies and Akita too.\n\nI tried to socialize my Akita with as much as I could, people and dogs. I walked her around Pet Smart every Saturday and Sunday plus puppy training school, there she would encounter tons of kids, adults and other dogs of all sizes.\n\nThe only thing my dog does not understand is \"babies\", she never had any contact with toddler sized children, so when walking her if she see's a toddler, she stops walking, sits on the sidewalk and just muffle barks like, \"what the hell is that?\".\n\nIts not something I can rectify either because I can't exactly ask someone \"hey can I test my Akita with your baby?\". So if you have any family members with very small kids, get the puppy acquainted with how a baby looks and smells, take the mystery out of it. My Akita has superb temperament, but in all honesty I would be worried about very small children near her, she just doesn't understand them. She loves teenagers the most though, she dances (shaking her butt from left to right) as they approach her.\n\nFor chew toys, the best I have found is the firemans hose toys, usually long snake like things, but man they are tough to rip I have a couple that have lasted nearly a year.\n\nNow can we have some puppy pics please?", 
    "Hello!  I am curious if anyone can take a stab at what my puppy is.  She is approx. 1 year old, approx 45-50 lbs+.   We rescued her as a \"Shepherd mix\".  For a while, I felt she was Anatolian shepherd mix.  However, as time went on, she seemed to be too small to be an ASD, even though she was mixed.   She is a bit taller than our 4 year old GSD/BMC mix.  She is around 22\" tall at the shoulders I believe.   Considering her black markings, and her tail, I feel like she could be ASD/Husky.  Which might be the reason why she is as small as she is.  She is the sweetest dog ever, but EXTREMELY dominant.  As you can see in the bottom picture where she is sitting on our 4 year old GSD mixes head! .  We have had her professionally trained, and we have to be extremely strict continuing her training in order to prevent as much dominating as possible.   Any ideas?   And if anyone is confident in what breed(s) she is, would you have any idea on how big she may get?  I know that's almost impossible to tell.  Just looking for some opinions I guess", 
    "I can't see ASD x Husky giving that ear shape/set. I thought I could see a bit of a Bully look about her head - Pit Bull? - which might fit with your description of her temperament. Crossed with what, who knows?, something with a hound like ear. I'm glad she has found such a caring home. She is lovely.", 
    "Looks bit like Boxer X Labrador", 
    "You could be right about the Labrador Tina. That is a better suggestion than a hound ear.", 
    "Thank you for the replies!  Yeah, some do see pit in her face lol.  Also, some see labrodor.   The only problem I think of if she is a Lab/Boxer,  is where does she get the light fawn color from?  Correct me if I'm wrong but Lab doesn't have a fawn color, and boxers fawn is darker.  Almost like an auburn color.  \n\nOne major factor that lead me to believe she is ASD, is she has double dew claws.   Also, if you look at her face, check out her \"eye liner\".   It just screams ASD to me.    Her tail also curls up most of the time, which could be ASD, or Husky trait.   What boggles my mind, is if she is ASD,  the fact that she is only 45-50 lbs at approx. a year old.   We are feeding her 3 cups a daily (1.5 in the morning, 1.5 in the evening).  And she doesn't always even finish those meals right away.  So I feel like we are feeding her just fine.",

I wasn't involved in the training while she was at the facility, as she trainer said that wasn't necessary.  Both dogs were there for 2 weeks.  There was a lot of basic training, to get both dogs to realize neither of them were the boss.  I'm at work right now, so I don't have the sheet with me.  However, she gave me a detailed report on what to do going forward to stick to her training.\n\nThe training worked in the sense that she learned a few things.  However, we did have to re-home the other dog unfortunately.  If we were to keep the other dog, it would have been a huge risk with the baby there, and we didn't want to take it.   Both dogs seemed fine around each other after the training.  However, we couldn't let them have toys together, or laying around at all, we had to be a certain way with their food/treats, and with the baby coming, it wouldn't work out.   Thankfully, my cousin was able to take her, so she has a great home!", 
    "While I'm here, here are some updated pics of her. I just took these last night.  She's still on the smaller/medium side.  And I'm pretty convinced she's about done growing.   She MIGHT weigh 50 lbs now.  But I think she's just shy of that.",

I do train her myself.  It was just a specific situation that became out of my hands.  I'm no professional trainer.  I enjoy doing it, but I have a LOT to learn.

A Great Pyrenean comes from the Basque region of France/Spain and has a totally white coat.\n\nIn the early 80's when I lived in South Africa, a friend of mine bought a Great Pyrenean male puppy that I fell in love with and after searching for months I bought a female Great Pyrenean puppy, called Sabrina. At 3 months she was already larger than Sally my 2 year old Springer Spaniel and by the time she was 8 months old she was nearly three times Sally's size!  As a family dog you couldn't fault her because despite being large she was always gentle with my young sons and their friends, but not very popular with the neighbours, because being bred to guard sheep she'd sleep much of the day and stay awake all night ... not barking but woofing at the slightest noise.  Although she didn't need a lot of exercise as she got older, preventing her from escaping from the garden became a problem as you only had to leave the gate open for a few seconds and she'd be gone!  As both my friend, who lived on a 20 acre farm. and I found out a GP can cover a great distance in a short time and you don't go looking for them on foot but by car.

    "I have just posted 3 on another thread.  Muffin is a mix, but definitely there's Kangal in there.  I will try to remember to whip out the camera when we see the Kangals.  There are three about a mile from us, with a herd to look after.  I have seen a couple of HUGE ones.  I mean one looked like it could have been ridden and the other looked like a sheep.  Of course I know they tend to be a coffee/creamy colour but our muffin ls more of a caramel colour.  Her dark nose markings are disappearing as she gets older.  I endlessly speculate on whether she is part Alsatian or something like a Hound.  Ooh hang on I can post pics of a friend's Kangal.",

    "I've been asked to rehome an 8month puppy who i think may be an anatolian shepherd dog. I've never seen one of these dogs before, or even heard of them, I'm only guessing that this is what she is based on pictures that I've seen, she looks a lot like one. But she's also got a line of fur down her back, like a ridgeback, i dont know if anatolians have this?\r\nI'd very much appreciate some advice on this breed as i dont want to welcome her into our home if its not going to be good for her long term becauseim inexperienced and wont be able to handle her properly.\r\nI also know she cant stay where she is, her owner wants me to take her tonight. What should i do?", 
    "is this as well as the two staffy pups?  Is this for real?  No offence but it seems a little odd...", 
    "oh, no, we're not getting the puppies now, lol! seems like you missed a lot of the drama yesterday", 
    "sorry just read some more of your posts.  You're not getting the staffs right?  As far as the Anatolian goes...they are NOT an easy breed, they have very strong guarding instincts and the dog is at an adoloscent age which sounds like trouble to me.  If your only experience of dogs is Lhasa Apsos it may be a shock to the system.  Anatolians can be dominant and aggresssive with other animals too.  Why is the owner getting rid of the dog?  It may be too much for her to handle., maybe?", 
    "ibelieveinangel said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\noh, no, we're not getting the puppies now, lol! seems like you missed a lot of the drama yesterday Click to expand...\n\ndoh! posted at same time!", 
    "no, i've had experience with big dogs too, but i've never even heard of anatolians. everything ive looked at so far has said that they are difficult to handle, easily trainable but only if they want to do it coz they're stubborn, lol! Obviously we have other pets too, she plays with my lhasa sometimes but im worried they wont get on if they live together. i want to do what's best for her cozshe is absolutely lovely and she really cant stay where she is! And i know the sort of people she could end up with if i dont have her!\r\nAt the moment she gets on ok with cats, and she's really good with my son. I'm just worried that if i cant train her properly then she'll become overly dominant and take over the house, lol!", 
    "To be honest regardless of breed if this dog is 8 months and has been passed from home to home already and is now unmanageable by your neighbour it hardly sounds like an ideal first time dog.\n\r\nIf your neighbour really wants rid tonight and thats not a bit of blackmail they should be getting in touch with a good rescue to take her and not just handing her over to anyone (no offense intended).\n\r\nIf I was you I would sit back take stock of what you want in a dog and what you can offer a dog, then do lots of research to find a good rescue that knows their dogs, or if you want a specific breed that you've researched go and look for the breed rescues, they all have them.\n\r\nBut take your time and  make sure its the right dog for you.", 
    "how rude, im not just anyone   no, hes going away for 2 weeks tomorrow morning so needs me to have her tonight, but he said that he cant handle her cos he hasnt got enough time for her, and she's too energetic for him so he doesnt want her back when he gets home. The only reason he's asked me to do it is because he knows us, knows our other pets, his daughter plays with my son a lot and its technically her dog. I think he still wants to be able to see her just cant cope with actually owning her. This dog's been to my house before, gets on ok with my other animals, is good with my son. Like i said, id love to have her, its just the practicality of it if she gets too much to handle, i dont want her to keep being passed from home to home \n\r\noh, sorry, forgot to say, i dont think its the dog that's unmanageable i think its the owners of her that have been incompetent. my neighbour actually got her from a party so that kind of shows what sort of people she's had to put up with! she's actually very good at the mo!", 
    "in that case then, I would think about taking her on a trial basis and finding a really good training school run by qualified instructors (apdt etc.) and see how you get on.  It does sounds as though you are sorely tempted.  Listen to your gut feelings though.  If you think it won't work, don't do it, but if you think she will fit in, give her a try.  Good luck with whatever you decide.",

    "I think it is highly unlikely she is a purebred anatolian. anatolians are not common at all and are also quite expensive i imagine. And also due to them being not as common there will be less chance of irresponsible breeders which is obviously where her current owner got her from, judging by what you have said about him aquiring her from a party!\r\nI think the best thing you can do is assess the dog on her own merits, if you are going to take her on, then take her for the 2 weeks on a trial basis and be honest with yourself during that time as to whether she is really suitable for your home.\r\nANY dog can be trained, regardless of breed, its just that some breeds are easier than others and alot depends on the dogs individual temperament.\r\nGood luck with whatever you decide.", 
    "I would tell your friend to take the dog to a reputable rescue. Then maybe you could ask the Rescue to help you find a suitable dog. The whole affair, from Back-Yard-Breeders to a puppy owned by someone who doesn`t know who bred it or even what breed it is indicates that perhaps a bit of expertise would be helpful.", 
    "you seem tepted andyou know the dog well. I would agree, take her on for the two weeks. One way or another her life will be changed for that two weeks anyway if they are going on holiday and you will be able to see if she can fit in with your family.\n\nShepherds whatever the mix can be wonderful dogs. They can get closely bonded to their families and become protective so socialisation is important, but a good training class or social dog walk should help no end to prevent that. Nearly all the shepherd I have ever met have been adorable cuddle monsters! \n\nIn the end you know the dog and your situation but my gut feeling would be, what harm can two weeks do? Watch her with your little dog and have a plan in mind to separate them if tensions get too high. But there's no reason they can't get over any tensions and get along fine after a month or two.", 
    "thanks, that really helps, i dont think i really have a choice anyway, if i dont take her at least for the 2 weeks then what would happen to her? he only asked me yesterday and is planning on leaving tomorrow! when we went away for a week we had arrangements AND a backup plan for our pets about 3 months before we left, lol!\r\ni think having her on a trial basis is a good idea, and i hope she fits in cos i dont want her to settle and then be uprooted again \r\nim not entirely sure she is anatolian, if she is its prob a cross, but she really does look like one. i wish i had a pic to show, i'd love someone to tell me what she is",

    "I have an anatolian shepherd dog, and they do not have a ridge of hair down their backs.  They tend to look like giant labradors with a high percentage having a black mask. (mine doesn't).  Their tails curl over when they are on guard.   I've had my boy since he was 7 weeks old, he is now 2.  Anatolians can be very stubborn, they are highly intelligent and will dominate if you let them.  They require a high degree of attention, long walks and proper training.  They grow up to be very large animals, my boy is 63kg (and not overweight) and over 6 ft tall on his back paws.  I would be very wary of taking on an 8 month old anatolian who appears to have been rehomed a lot.  These animals have a reputation (undeserved in my book) for being over-protective and I know of a couple who have killed cats/dogs/foxes.\n\r\nI would not recommed this dog to anyone who does not have experience of large, dominant dogs.\n\r\nI'd be happy for you to e-mail me if you wish to discuss this further\n\r\nRegards\n\r\nSue\r\n(Monty's Mum)",
